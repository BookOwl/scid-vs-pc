The rest of the stuff is legalese cribbed mightily from the Tcl/Tk
license.  Basically, if you like ezsmtp and use it regularly, buy me a
cold, frosty Stout at the Tcl conference sometime.  Other than that,
you are under no obligation whatsoever -- do with it what you may but
please don't sue me....  I'd like to know where ezsmtp is being used,
so drop me an email and let me know.
