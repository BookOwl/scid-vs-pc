<ul>
<p>The Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) is a web portal where people from
all over the world play chess.  Features include a player rating system,
international tournaments and the ability to follow and discuss other people's
games.</p>

<p>Though it is possible to play anonymously, to create a user account
visit <url http://www.freechess.org>www.freechess.org</url>.
Players may peruse their games at <url http://ficsgames.org>http://ficsgames.org</url>.
</p>

<p>To start FICS use <run ::fics::config><green>Play--<gt>Internet (FICS)</green></run>.

set helpTitle(BrowsingPGN) "PGN"
set helpText(BrowsingPGN) {<h1>PGN Files and Scid</h1>

<p>PGN is the standard format for chess games, and Scid will happily open and display large game archives.
<i>But PGN is not the native format of Scid's Databases. It takes a little
effort, but using <a Scid>Scid Databases</a> instead of PGN is highly recommended.</i></p>

<p>To open PGN files, use the <run ::file::Open><green>File-<gt>Open</green></run> dialog,
<a Switcher draganddrop>Drag and Drop</a>, or the
<a Pgnscid>Pgnscid</a> utility for quick imports and troubleshooting.</p>


<h3>Viewing Games</h3>

<p>Once you have loaded a game, open the <a PGN>PGN Window</a>
to browse the game. Clicking on moves will advance the game, or 
use the wheel-mouse in the main window. Clicking on <a Comment>comments</a>
allows you to edit them.</p>

<p>In the <a MainWindow GameInfo>Game Info</a> window, you will see the names of the players and
tournament. These names are also clickable, and diaply information about
the tournament and how the player performed. This is the start of Scid's
database capabilities.</p>

<p>If you have opened a multigame PGN, the <a GameList>Game List</a>
widget allows you to browse the games and select those of interest.
<i>The Game List also serves to select and delete games from Scid's
databases.</i></p>

<h3>Editing Games</h3>

<p>Changes made to a single game PGN file may be saved back to PGN via <run
::pgn::savePgn .><green>File--<gt>Save PGN</green></run>. 

But If you wish to change a file with multiple games, it must first be
converted to a <a Scid>Scid Database</a>. The easiest way to do this is by
opening the <a GameList>Game List</a> and dragging the PGN file to the Clipbase.
After making changes in the Clipbase, then use <a Export>Export</a> to write them
back to PGN.

set helpTitle(Hints) "Scid Hints"
set helpText(Hints) {<h1>Scid Hints</h1>

  <h4>Can I load automatically load a databases</h4>
  <p>
  Only by adding databases, PGN files or <a EPD>EPD files</a>
  to the command line. For example:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>scid  mybase  games.pgn.gz</b> </li>
  </ul>
  will load the database <b>mybase</b> and the gziped PGN file <b>games.pgn.gz</b>.
  </p>

  <h4>How can i change the board size?</h4>
  <p>
  Use the shortcut keys <b>Control+Shift+LeftArrow</b> and
  <b>Control+Shift+RightArrow</b>, or <b>Control+Wheelmouse</b>.
  </p>

  <h4>Can I hide the next move?</h4>
  <p>
  You can hide the next move via the main context (right-click) menu, <b>Hide next move</b>.
  </p>

  <h4>How can I see the ECO opening code for the current position?</h4>
  <p>
  The ECO code is displayed on the bottom line of the game
  information box, below the chessboard in the <a MainWindow>main window</a>,
  if you have the ECO classification file (<b>scid.eco</b>) loaded. <br>
  The <a ECO>ECO codes</a> help page explains how to load the ECO classification
  file and save options so it will be loaded every time you start Scid.
  </p>

  <h4>While entering a game, I realise i have entered an incorrect move half-way though. Can I easily correct it?</h4>
  <p>
  You must use the <a Import>Import</a> window. See <a Moves Mistakes>entering moves</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h4>How do I copy games from one database to another?</h4>
  <p>
  Use the <a Switcher>Database Switcher</a> to drag and drop (<a Filter>filter</a>)
  games between databases.
  </p>

  <h4>Every time I enter a move to replace another, I get a
  "Replace Move?" dialog. Can I avoid this?</h4>
  <p>
  De-select the <b>Ask before replacing moves</b> option in the <menu>Options: Moves</menu> menu.
  </p>

  <h4>How can I use the tree window on a selection of games, not my whole database?</h4>
  <p>
  Using the Filter and <a Switcher>Database Switcher</a>, copy the relevant games to <a Clipbase>Clipbase</a>.
  Then open the tree window in the Clipbase.
  </p>

  <h4>The Tree is slow for large databases. How do I speed it up?</h4>
  <p>
  Save the Tree cache often, to save tree results for future use.
  See the caching section of the <a Tree>Tree</a> help page for details.
  </p>

  <h4>Can I edit the PGN representation of the game directly?</h4>
  <p>
  No. Yo must edit its PGN representation using the <a Import>Import game</a> window.
  Just open it (shortcut key: <b>Control+Shift+I</b>) , select
  <b>Paste current game</b>, edit the game and then <b>Import</b>.
  </p>

  <h4>My database has several spellings for some player names. How do I
  correct them?</h4>
  <p>
  You can edit individual names or spellcheck all the names in a database
  with the commands in the <menu>File: Maintenance</menu> menu.
  See the <a Maintenance Editing>maintenance</a> page.
  </p>

  <h4>I have two databases open: one with my own games, and a large database of
  grandmaster games. How do I compare one of my games to those in the large
  database?</h4>
  <p>
  Just open the <a Tree>Tree</a> window for the reference database and
  switch back to the game to compare by means of the database
  switcher. Alternatively, a base can directly be opened as tree via
  the <term>File</term> menu.

  <h4><name GameInfo>Game Information Area</name></h4>
  <p>
  Below the chessboard is general information about the current game. 
  It includes the <b>Player Names</b> and <b>Ratings</b>,
  <b>Event</b> and <b>Site</b> fields, and <b>ECO</b> codes.
  The <b>Game Number</b> (and any flags) show specific info about this game in the database.
  </p>
  <p>
  If Scid can find a suitable <a PInfo Photos>photo file</a>  then player photos will appear here. Clicking on them will make them smaller.
  </p>
  <p>
  The game information area also displays <a PInfo Photos>player photos</a>
  and <a TB>tablebase</a> results</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Display options for this window are in <green>Options-<gt>Game Information</green>.
  </p>

  <h4>Material Values</h4>
  <p>
  On the right hand side of the board the <b>material</b> balance is displayed by small chess pieces.
  One may also right-click the board and select 'Toggle Material' to display all taken pieces.
  </p>

  <h4><name Status>The Status Bar</name></h4>
  <p>
  The status bar shows information about the current database. This includes
  how many games are currently in the <a Filter>filter</a>, and whether the base is read-only.
  When entering moves with the keyboard, matching moves are displayed here.
  </p>

  <h4><name Autoplay>Autoplay Mode</name></h4>
  <p>
  In autoplay mode, Scid automatically plays the moves in the current game,
  moving forward until the end of the game. The time delay between moves can
  be set from the <green>Options--<gt>Moves</green> menu
  </p>
  <p>
  If you start autoplay mode when the <a Analysis>analysis window</a> is open,
  the game is <a Analysis Annotate>annotated</a>: the score and analysis for each position
  are added to the game as a new variation just before each move is made.

set helpTitle(Docking) "Docked Windows"
set helpText(Docking) {<h1>Docked Windows</h1>
<p>
The Docked Windows feature allows Scid to have a single window, with the smaller windows
tiling within. Options for this feature are found in <b>Options-<gt>Windows</b>, and this is also where you
can load any of the three built-in layouts, or save your own window arrangements.
</p><p>
Arranging Docked Windows is a little difficult. One can right-click any tab (except the main
board) and select to move to the side of the current paned window, or one can
drag the tab and group it with other tabs in another paned window.</p>
<p>
Window focus automatically follows the mouse around, and also impacts which keyboard bindings are active.
Most bindings are active when the mouse is over the main board.</p>
<p>
If Scid fails to start, use the <b>-nodock</b> command-line option to restart in non-docked mode.

set helpTitle(Moves) "Entering Moves"
set helpText(Moves) {<h1>Move Entry and Options</h1>
  <p>
  Scid allows moves to be made using the mouse or keyboard.
  Use the mouse to click on a piece, and then click on the
destination square. Alternatively one may drag the piece.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Keyboard moves are made using the standard notation.
  Castling is done with <b>OO</b>, or <b>OK</b> and <b>OQ</b>
  for King and Queenside respectively.
  </p>

  <h4>Retracting Moves</h4>
  <p>
  To take back a move, press the Left-Arrow.
  </p>

  <h4>Replacing Moves</h4>
  <p>
  When you enter a move where a move already exists,
  Scid will ask if you want to replace the
  move (when the old move and all after it will be lost), or
  add the new move as a variation. If one finds this annoying, 
  it is possible to skip this dialog by unchecking the
  <green>Options--<gt>Moves--<gt>Ask Before Replacing Moves</green> menu option
  </p>

  <h4><name Undo>Undo</name></h4>
  <p>
  From 4.6, Scid vs. PC has Undo and Redo features. This allows a 10 edit history
  for Move, Variation, Comment and Game Information changes. The Undo and Redo commands are 
  bound to <b>Control-z</b> and <b>Control-y</b>, but please use carefully as these shortcuts
  are also the defaults for editing text windows such as the Comment Editor.
  </p>

  <h4><name Trial>Trial Mode</name></h4>
  <p><i>
  Undo and Redo are disabled in Trial Mode.
  </i></p>
  <p>
  If you are studying a game and reach a position where you want to try
  an alternative variation without altering the game, select
  <green>Edit--<gt>Try variation</green> to enter trial
  mode. You can then make temporary moves and changes to the
  game, and return to the original position when you exit trial mode.
  </p>

  <h3><name Mistakes>Correcting Mistakes</name></h3>
  <p>
  If you are entering a game and suddenly see an incorrect move several
  moves earlier, it is possible to correct it without losing the extra
  moves you have added. The only way is to edit the PGN representation
  of the game. Open the <a Import>Import</a> window, select "Paste Current
  Game", correct the incorrect move, then select "Import".
  </p>

  <h3>Keyboard Move Entry</h3>
  <p>
  To enter moves from the keyboard, simply press letter and digit
  keys. Accepted moves should be in <term>SAN notation</term>,
  <i>without</i> the capture symbol (x) or the promotion symbol (=).
  Moves are matched case-insensitively, so you can type
  [n][f][3] instead of Nf3, for example (see below about Bishop/Pawn conflicts).
  </p>
  <p>
  To ensure that no move is a prefix of any other move, the notation
  for kingside and queenside castling is [O][K] and
  [O][Q] respectively, instead of the usual O-O and O-O-O.
  [This is a bug!]
  </p>
  <p>
  As you enter a move, the status bar will show the list of matching moves.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Note</b> Lower-case letter matches to a pawn first, so a
  [b] can match to a pawn or Bishop, but if there is a conflict
  you must use a capital [B] for the Bishop move.
  </p>

  <h4>Coordinate Move Entry</h4>
  <p>
  The Coordinate Move Entry option allows one to input moves of the form
  <b>a2a4</b>  and <b>g1f3</b> (instead of Nf3). This is the default, but it
  interferes with the Auto-Completion feature.
  </p>

  <h4>Auto-Completion</h4>
  <p>
  In the Options menu, you can select Keyboard Auto-Completion of moves.
  With auto-completion, a move is made as soon as you have typed enough
  to distinguish it from any other legal move. For example, with
  auto-completion, you would only need to type [n][f] instead
  of [n][f][3] for <b>Nf3</b> in the starting position.
  This feature only works with <b>pawn moves</b> if <b>Coordinate Move Entry</b>
  is disabled.
  </p>

  <h4>Suggested Moves</h4>
  <p>
  The Suggested Move feature, if enabled, highlights all squares
  to which there is a legal move. This can be confusing at times, as is disblaed by default in Scid vs. PC.
  </p> 

  <h3><name Null>Entering Null Moves</name></h3>
  <p>
  <a Variations Null>Null</a> (empty) moves can be useful in variations, where
  you want to skip a move for one side. You can enter a null move with the
  mouse by capturing one king with the other king, or with the keyboard by
  typing "<b>--</b>" (that is, pressing the minus key twice).
  </p>

  <h3><name Informant>Common Annotation Symbols</h3>
  <p>
  One may add annotation symbols (or <a NAGs>NAGs</a>) using the keyboard
  (and without the <a Comment>comment editor)</a>. Below are the relevant shortcuts.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid also uses some of these symbols for <a Analysis Annotating>Automatic
  Annotations</a>. To this end, the symbols are associated
  with a certain pawn value which can be set via 
  <run configInformant><green>Options-<gt>Game Information-<gt>Configure Informant Values</green></run>. 
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li> !	[!][Return]</li>

set helpTitle(Searches) "Searches"
set helpText(Searches) {<h1>Searches in Scid</h1>
  <p>
  Scid can perform several different types of searches. The main ones are:
  <ul>
  <li><a Searches Header>General</a> (or Header) searches - such as Players, Result or Date</li>
  <li><a Searches Board>Game Positions</a> - matching the Current Board</li>
  <li><a Searches Material>Material and Piece Pattern</a> searches.</li>
  </p>
  <p>
  Searches display their results by adjusting the <a Filter>Filter</a> with matching games.
  By default they will <b>Reset</b> the Filter (ie - search the whole database). But one may also
  <b>Add to</b>, or <b>Restrict</b> the Filter, allowing complex searches to be built up.
  </p>
  <p>
  With Position, Tree, and Material/Pattern searches, when you load a matching game
  it will automatically show the relevant game position, (except
  - in the unlikely event - that the position occurred after move 255 which causes a byte overflow).
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Most searches only apply to the Main Line of a game, and not to Variations</i>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Positional Searches can also be performed by the <a Tree>Tree Window</a>.</i>
  </p>

  <h3><name Header>General (Header) Searches</name></h3>
  <p>
  This search is for game information stored
  in the game header (Player Names, Date etc) or PGN text of a game.
  For a successful match, <b>all fields must match</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The name fields (White, Black, Event, Site and Round) match on any text
  inside the name, case-insensitive and ignoring spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can do more precise searches for the White, Black, Event,
  Site and Round fields by using the <b>?</b> (one character) and
  <b>*</b> (zero or more characters) wild-cards, and enclosing the search in
  double quotes. For example a search for the site <b>USA</b>
  will find American cities and also <b>Lausanne SUI</b>, which is probably
  not what you wanted! <b>"*USA"</b> (remember the
  double-quotes) is probably what you wanted.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you are searching for a particular player (or pair of opponents) as White
  or Black and it does not matter what color they played, select the
  <b>Ignore Colors</b> option.
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, the Header search can be used to find any text
  (case-sensitive and without wildcards) in the PGN representation of
  each game.  You may enter up to three text phrases, and they must
  all appear in a game for it to be a match.  This search is very
  useful for searching in the comments or extra tags of a game (such
  as <b>lost on time</b> or <b>Annotator</b>), or for a move sequence
  like <b>Bxh7+</b> and <b>Kxh7</b> for a bishop sacrifice on h7 that
  was accepted.  However, this type of search can be <i>very</i> slow
  since all the games that match other criteria must be decoded and
  scanned for the text phrases.  So it is a good idea to limit these
  searches as much as possible.  Here are some examples.  To find
  games with under-promotions to a rook, search for <b>=R</b> and also
  set the <b>Promotions</b> flag to Yes.  When searching for text that
  would appear in comments, set the <b>Comments</b> flag to Yes.  If
  you are searching for the moves <b>Bxh7+</b> and <b>Kxh7</b>, you
  may want to restrict the search to games with a 1-0 result and at
  least 40 half-moves, for example, or do a material/pattern search
  first to find games where a white bishop moves to h7.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Note - if a search by <a ECO>ECO</a> code is performed, games
  that have no ECO code attached are ignored</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Searching for extra PGN tags (such as "Annotator") can be done 
  within the <a Maintenance Tags>Maintenance Strip Tags</a> feature.
  </p>

  <h3><name Board>Current Board Searches</name></h3>
  <p>
  This search finds games that contain the currently displayed position,
  ignoring castling and <i>en passant</i> rights.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are four different board searches:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>Exact</b> - the two positions must match on every square </li>
  <li> <b>Pawns</b> - the pawn structure must match exactly, but other pieces
  can be anywhere </li>
  <li> <b>Files</b> - the number of white and black pawns on each file must match
  exactly, but other pieces can be anywhere </li>
  <li> <b>Material</b> - pawns and pieces can be anywhere </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The pawns search is useful for studying openings by pawn structure, and
  the files and material searches are useful for finding similar positions
  in an endgame.
  </p>
  <p>
  To search for an arbitrary position, set the board position 
  via <green>Edit--<gt>Setup Board</green> before running the search.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can request that the search look in variations (instead of only
  examining actual game moves) by selecting <b>Look in variations</b>
  , but this may slow the search if your database
  is large with many games and variations.
  </p>

  <h3><name Material>Material / Pattern Searches</name></h3>
  <p>
  This powerful feature is useful for finding end-game or middle-game themes.
  You can specify minimum and maximum amounts of each type of material,
  and patterns such as a bishop on f7, or a pawn on the f-file.
  </p>
  <p>
  A number of common material and pattern settings are provided, such
  as Rook vs. Pawn endings, or isolated Queens pawns.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Hint -
  The speed of pattern searches can vary widely, and be reduced 
  by setting restrictions intelligently. For example,
  if you set the minimum move number to 20 for an ending, all games that
  end in under 20 moves can be skipped</i>.
  </p>

  <h3><name Move>Move Searches</name></h3>
  <p>
  Move Searches allow one to search for particular moves and combinations.
  Enter the move(s) in the entry box, and matching positions will be 
  found. Move combinations can extend unlimited, and to match any
  move, use a '?' character.</p>
  <p> For example, use <b>Rh8 ? R1h7</b> to find doubling of rooks on the H file.</p>
  <p>The <b>Check Test</b> option allows one to input moves of the form <b>Qh7+</b>
  (or <b>Rh8#</b>, but these checks slow the search down a little. Judicious
use of <b>Side to Move</b> can speed up the search.</p>
  </p>

  <h3><name Settings>Saving Search Settings</name></h3>
  <p>
  The Material/Pattern and Header Search windows provide a
  <b>Save</b> button, enabling one to save the current
  search settings to a SearchOptions file (<b>.sso</b>).
  Loading this file is done from <green>Search--<gt>Load Search File</green> menu.
  </p>

  <h3>Search Times and Skipped Games</h3>
  <p>
  Most searches produce a message indicating the time taken and the number
  of games that were skipped. A <b>skipped</b> game is one that can
  be excluded from the search without decoding any of its moves, based on
  information stored in the index. See the help page on
  <a Formats>file formats</a> for more information.

  <p>
  Scid's Filter represents a subset of games in the current base or pgn archive. At any time, each game is either

set helpTitle(Clipbase) "The Clipbase"
set helpText(Clipbase) {<h1>The Default Database</h1>
  <p>
  In addition to physical databases existing on disk, Scid provides
  a transient one known as the <b>Clipbase</b>. It is opened by default, and
  used to cut and paste games between other bases via the <a
  Switcher>Database Switcher</a>. Additionally, each base has a game numbered 0
  which also acts as a scratch game.
  </p>
<h3>Use</h3>
  <p>
  The Clipbase is useful as a temporary database; for merging
  the results of searches on more than one database or for treating the
  results of a search as a separate database.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, assume you want to prepare for an opponent and have searched
  a database so the <a Filter>filter</a> contains only games where
  the opponent played white.
  You can copy these games to the Clipbase by opening the <a Switcher>Switcher</a> and
  dragging from the database to the Clipbase.
  Then, switch to the Clipbase, and open
  the <a Tree>Tree Window</a> to examine that players repertoire.
  </p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>
  You can copy games from one open database directly to another
  without using the Clipbase as an intermediary.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Clipbase cannot be closed; selecting <green>File--<gt>Close</green> is equivalent
  to emptying it with <green>Edit--<gt>Empty Clipbase</green>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Games in the Clipbase consume your computers memory. So please consider this when copying a large number of games.

set helpTitle(Variations) "Variations"
set helpText(Variations) {<h1>Variations</h1>

  <p>
  A Variation is an alternative sequence of
  moves at a particular point in a game. They can contain
  comments and recursive subvariations.
  </p>
  <p>The <button tb_outvar 32> <button tb_invar 32>  <button tb_addvar 32>
  buttons are used to exit, enter and add variations respectively.
  And in the <b>Edit Menu</b>, and <a PGN>PGN</a> context menu, are further useful commands.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  If you want to enter a variation without being asked for a
  confirmation, use the middle mouse button of the mouse to enter the
  move.
  </i></p>

  <h4>Variation Arrows</h4>
  <p>
  Scid vs. PC has clickable Variation Arrows (enabled via
  Options / Moves / Show Variation Arrows). But for this feature to work, the
  <b>Variations Window</b> (Options / Moves / Show Variation Window) must first
  be disabled.
  </p>

  <h4><name Paste>Paste Variation</h4>
  <p>
  This feature (in the Edit Menu) will try to add the currently selected text as a variation.
  It is not very sophisticated; but very useful when adding a <b>single line of MulitPV analysis</b>
from a paused engine.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Please see <a Variations Null>below</a> in regards to adding null moves.</i>
  </p>

  <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
  <p>
  When a move has variations they are shown in the game information
  area. You can click on a variation to enter it, or press "v", whence
  the <b>Variation Window</b> will pop up.
  Setting Options-<gt>Moves-<gt>ShowVariationWindow will automatically show
  this window when a variation is found.</p>
  <p>In the variation window one can select a variation with the up/down
  keys and then hitting enter. This allows for game navigation with keyboard only.
  To leave a variation, use "z", or if at the beginning of the variation, the up arrow.
  </p>

  <h3><name Null>Null Moves</name></h3>
  <p>
  Null moves are used to skip a move by one side. This is of course illegal,
  but is a well known idea, and useful for analyzing your opponent's immediate threats.
  </p>
  <p>
  Null moves are displayed as "<b>--</b>" and can be made by typing this string, or by
  using the mouse to make a <b>King</b> x <b>King</b> capture.
  They are not a part of the PGN Standard, so when
  <a Export>exporting games</a> to PGN, Scid provides (among
  other options) one to convert null moves to comments - for compatibility with other software.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  Some other programs use <term>Z0</term> as a null move, and Scid will successfully import this move.
  </i></p>
  <p>
  One final issue arises with Engine Analysis. If you have null move <b>at then
end</b> of a game or variation , the <a Analysis>analysis window</a> will not
successfully add a variation to it. Instead, one should <b>first add a single
move</b>, then variations may be added. This note also applies to the <b>
<b>Paste Variation</b> feature.
  </p>

set helpTitle(Comment) "Comment Editor"
set helpText(Comment) {<h1>The Comment Editor</h1>
  <p>
  The <run ::commenteditor::Open><green>Comment Editor</green></run> lets you annotate games
  with comments and <a NAGs>annotations</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <p>
  Comments are text associated with individual moves.
  You can add comments by typing them in the entry box (where
  the Control-A, Control-Z and Control-Y shortcuts can be used to
  manipulate text and undo changes).
  Comments are <b>automatically stored</b> whenever you move to another position in the game.
  Control-Enter saves the comment and closes the window.
  </p>

  <p>
  Comments may also exist at the start of a game or variation.
  To add a comment <b>prefixing a variation</b>,
  go to the first var move and hit the left arrow key before adding 
  the comment.
  </p>

  <p><i>You can move the game forward and back by using the wheel mouse, or control+left/right keys.</i></p>

  <h3>Annotation Symbols</h3>
  <p>
  Scid uses the <a PGN>PGN Standard</a>
  and <a NAGs>NAGs</a> for annotation symbols.
  While the most common symbols  are displayed
  as Ascii characters (such as "!" or "+-"), others must be entered as the appropriate
  numeric value (ie - a number from 1 to 255).
  For example, the NAG value 36 means "White has the initiative" and will
  be displayed as "$36" in the PGN window.
  </p>
  <p>
  The most common move evaluation symbols (!, ?, !!,
  ??, !? and ?!) can be added firectly from the main window by typing the symbol followed by
  the [Return] key.  This is especially useful if you are <a Moves>entering chess moves</a>
  using the keyboard.
  </p>

  <h3><name Diagrams>Diagrams</name></h3>
  <p>
  In addition to text comments, Scid supports an array of colour symbols and arrows.
  Press then <img bookmark_down> button to see a small board and diagrams.
  Arrows can be drawn (and erased) by dragging between two squares on this board.
  </p>
  <p> Normally, the comments associated with these diagrams are hidden in the PGN
window, but can be viewed by deselecting "Hide Square/Arrow Codes" in the PGN window
options.</p>
  <p><i>Specific information about these diagrams are below, but it is not necessary to 
know these details.</i></p>
  </p>
  <h4>Colouring Squares</h4>
  <p>
  You can color any square using a special embedded command
  which can appear anywhere in a comment. The command format is:
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>[%mark square color]</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  where <b>square</b> is a square name like d4 and <b>color</b> is any
  recognized color name (such as red, blue4, darkGreen, lightSteelBlue)
  or RGB code (six hexadecimal digits such as #a0b0c8).
  If the color is omitted, it defaults to red.
  </p>
  <p>
  A comment may contain any number of color commands, but each must have
  in its own <b>[%mark ...]</b> tag.
  For example, the comment text</p>
  <p>
  <i>Now d6 [%mark d6] is weak and the knight can attack it
  from b5. [%mark b5 #000070]</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  will color d6 red and b5 with the dark-blue color #000070.
  </p>

  <h4>Drawing Arrows</h4>
  <p>
  You can draw an arrow from one square to another using a special
  comment command similar to the for coloring squares described above.
  The format is:
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>[%arrow fromSquare toSquare color]</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  where <b>fromSquare</b> and <b>toSquare</b> are square names like d4.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, the comment text:
  <p>
  <i>The c3-knight and c4-bishop control the weak d5 square.
  [%arrow c3 d5 red] [%arrow c4 d5 blue]</i>
  <p>
  will draw a red arrow from c3 to d5 and a blue one from c4 to d5.

set helpTitle(Crosstable) "Crosstable Window"
set helpText(Crosstable) {<h1>The Crosstable Window</h1>
  <p>
  The <run ::crosstab::Open><green>Crosstable</green></run> shows the
  tournament result for the current game in <b>All-Play-All, Swiss</b> or <b>Knockout</b> formats.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any game played up to <b>twelve months before or after</b> the current game,
  with <b>identical Event and Site</b> tags, is considered to be in the tournament.
  </p>

  <h4>Features</h4>
  <p>
  Clicking on a Game Result shows a menu from which one may Browse, Load or Merge a game.
  </p>
  <p>
From the menubar you'll be able to access the Display Options, edit the
<b>Event,  Site</b> or <b>Date</b> fields, export the table as <b>Text, LaTex
</b>or <b>HTML</b>, or choose the <b>Sort Criteria</b> for the crosstable.
  </p>
  <p>
When sorting by score, the <b>Group Scores</b> option shows a blank line
between players with the same score.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid vs. PC has a couple of extra features over mainline SCID: The ability to
  sort the table by <b>Nationality</b>, the <b>current game is shown in
green</b>, and an option for <b>3 Points for a Win</b>.  </p>

<h4>Table Format</h4>
  <p>
  One may view the tournament in All-Play-all, Swiss or Knockout formats.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>All-Play-All</b> format - for round-robin-type events - has a limit of 30
  players</li>
  <br>
  <li>The <b>Swiss</b> format - for tournaments with a large number of players - can
  display up to 200 players and up to 20 rounds.
  Scid uses the "Round" tag of each game to produce a Swiss
  crosstable, so you will not see any games if they don't have numeric "Round" values (1, 2, 3, etc).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Knockout</b> shows game results on a round-by-round nature.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Auto</b> will choose the best format automatically.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>
  For a good Crosstable, <b>duplicate games</b> should be marked for deletion, and
  Player, Site and Event names should be spelt consistently.  See
  <a Maintenance>Database Maintenance</a> for more information.

  <p>
  With the <run ::file::finder::Open><green>File--<gt>Finder</green></run>
  you can browse the filesystem for Scid files, perform backups and other file
operations.
  </p>

  <p>
  Double clicking a file will open it, while right-click will
  show a context menu from which you can perform
  various file operations:

  <ul>
  <li><term>Open</term>	Open the file.
  <li><term>Backup</term>	Makes a copy of the file with the current date and time appended to its name.</li>
  <li><term>Copy</term>	Copy the selected database to a new location.</li>

  <li><term>Rename</term>	Rename the selected database.</li>
  <li><term>Delete</term>	Delete the selected database.</li>
   </ul>
  <p>
   These functions are especially useful for si4 databases, which consist of three files.
  </p>

  <h3>Look in Subdirectories</h3>
  <p>
  This checkbox makes Scid recursively examine subdirectories for compatible
  files.  This, however, can take a long time, so you may not
  want to do it for large directory trees.  The process can be
  interrupted by pressing the <b>Stop</b> button.
  </p>

  <h3>Games Field</h3>
  <p>
  The meaning of this field depends on the file type.
  For Databases and PGN files, it is the number of games, and for EPD files the number of
  positions.
  </p>
  <p>
  For all file types except Scid Databases, the games field is only
  an estimate (represented by '~'), read from the first 64 Kilobytes.

  <p>
  The results can be sorted by Date, Number of Players, Number
  of Games, Mean Elo rating, Site, Event or the Winner by
  <b>clicking on a column title</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  But sorting can be slightly misleading. For example, clicking the Games
  column does not generally show *all* the tournaments with the greatest number of games.
  Rather, it simply sorts the current 100 games (for example)
  that are the first in the base to match the selection criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
  To address this issue, and also speed up tournament searches, select a fairly narrow Date range (a few years at most),
  or select a particular country - by choosing (or entering) its three-letter standard code.

  <p>
  The <run importPgnGame><green>Import Window</green></run> provides an easy way for you to paste a game
  into Scid from some other application or window.
  </p>
  <p>
  The top-most frame is where to enter or paste
  the game in PGN format, and the lower frame 
  provides feedback of any errors or warnings.
  </p>

  <p>
  <i>Scid provides several ways to access games in PGN. As well as the Import
  Window, games can be opened via <run ::file::Open><green>File-<gt>Open</green></run>.
  Large PGN archives can sometimes give Scid problems. A more reliable import method is the
  <a Pgnscid>Pgnscid</a> utility</i>
  </p>

  <h3>Editing the Current Game</h3>
  <p>
  The Import window also doubles as a way to make changes or corrections
  to a game. First paste the current game
  with <b>Paste Current Game</b>, then edit the moves
  , and click <b>Import</b> when done.
  </p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>
  Scid expects to see PGN header tags such as
  <ul>
  <li> <b>[Result "*"]</b> </li>
  </ul>
  before any moves, but pasting a game fragment such as
  <ul>
  <li> <b>1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.Qh5?! Nf6?? 4.Qxf7# 1-0</b> </li>

  <h3><name CCRL>CCRL Imports</name></h3>
  <p>
  The Computer Chess Rating Lists distributes PGN archives which can cause Scid problems.
  They use the Round field to represent unique game numbers, and Scid only supports 262,143 Round Names.
  You may wish to replace the "Round" field with "Rd", or some other tag.
  </p>
  <p>
  This can be achieved using the <b>sed</b> utility and the command

  <p>
  Commands to export games to other formats are found in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
  Four file formats are supported:

  <li><a PGN>PGN</a> The default chess game format</li>
  <li><term>HTML</term> for web pages</li>
  <li><term>HTML and JavaScript</term> for interactive web pages</li>
  <li><term>LaTeX</term> a popular typesetting system</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, on Unix systems, LaTeX can be converted to <a Export PDF>PDF</a>.
  </p>

<p>
  Diagrams are drawn (in HTML or LaTeX formats),
  wherever a <b>D</b> nag, or a comment (starts with <b>#</b>) appears.
  In the case of HTML, Scid's bitmaps directory should be placed alongside your exported file.
  </p>

  <h3>HTML with JavaScript</h3>
  <p>
  While the HTML export generates a static file that may contain
  static board diagrams, this format offers dynamic HTML, that allows
  to move through the game interactively with the mouse.
  </p>
  <p>
  This format consists of several files that need to be stored in a
  specific structure. Therefore, it is advisable to first generate a
  empty folder that will contain these files. The name of the main
  file can be specified and it will get the extension html (e.g.
  mygame.html). This file should be loaded by the web browser. The
  other files are required to exist in exactly the position the export
  filter places them. However, the whole folder can easily be uploaded
  to some web server.
  </p>

  <h3>LaTeX</h3>
  <p>
  Scid can export games to a LaTeX file.  Games are printed two columns
  to a page, and moves are in figurine algebraic notation with proper
  translation of the nag symbols. </p>
  <p>
  See <a LaTeX>Using LaTeX with Scid</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <h3><name PDF>Converting LaTeX to PDF</name></h3>
<p>
  can be achieved on Unix systems with the <b>pdflatex</b> command.
  A quick conversion is of the form:
<br>
<ul><li>pdflatex -interaction batchmode mytexfile.tex</li></ul>
</p>

  <h3><name Null>PGN Compatability Issues</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <url http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm>PGN Standard</url>
  has no <a Variations Null>null move</a> concept. So
  if you export games including them to PGN, other
  software may not be able to read these games correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
  To solve this problem, one should enable the <b>Convert null moves to comments</b> option.
  Of course, if you wish to later reimport the PGN file
  , with null moves preserved, disable this option.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid's use of Ascii strings (such as <b>+=</b> to represent annotations is also against the PGN standard.
  For compatability, <b>Symbolic annotation style</b> should be set to <b>$2 $14</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The use of '{' and '}' inside comments is also against the standard, and Scid vs. PC replaces these with parenthesis when exporting PGN.

  <h2>Installing Chess12 Font</h2>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p><i>
It should (hopefully!) work on most systems where dvips is the standard
tool used to produce PostScript files from DVI files.

After downloading and extracting chess12.tar.gz, you will need to set up some

set helpTitle(PGN) "PGN Window"
set helpText(PGN) {<h1>PGN Window</h1>

  <p>
  This section explains how to use Scid's <run ::pgn::Open><green>PGN Window</green></run>.
  </p>

  <p> <i>Other help subjects include <a BrowsingPGN>PGN files and Scid</a>,
  <a Export>Exporting</a>, and <a Import>Importing games</a></i> </p>

  <p>
  <i>Portable Game Notation is a common 
  <url http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm>standard</url>
  for representing chess games.  A PGN file consists of two
  sections - a 'Header' containing tags such as
  [White "Kasparov, Gary"] and
  [Result "1/2-1/2"], and a 'Body' containing the actual moves in standard
  algebraic notation (SAN) along with any <a Variations>variations</a>, <a NAGs>annotation
  symbols</a> and <a Comment>comments</a></i>.
  </p>

  <h3>General Use</h3>
  <p>
  The PGN Window allows one to navigate around the game. Clicking 
  on moves will jump to them, clicking on comments edits them.
  (And just like the main window, the <b>arrow keys</b>, <b>v</b> and <b>z</b> allow for
  game navigation).  Using the middle button displays a small
  board. Right-clicking displays a context menu.
  </p>

  <h3><name ttf>Chess Figurines</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <b>Chess Pieces</b> option displays small chess figurines instead of letters, to represent pieces.
  This feature is only available if truetype fonts are supported, and ScidChessStandard.ttf has successfully been installed,
  and may incur a small performance loss.
  </p>
  <p>
  On <b>Microsoft Windows</b>, the fonts are installed automatically, but may
  not be available until Windows has updated the font cache. If they aren't available, browse the Windows\Fonts directory
  and double click the Scid fonts.
  </p>
  <p> <b>OS X</b> users should also manually install the ttf fonts.
  </p>

  <h3>Options</h3>
  <p>
  The PGN menu contains options about how the game is displayed.
  Some of them include: Colour or Plain text, Short Header, Column Style and <b>Scrollbar</b>.
  Personalised <b>Colours</b> may also be selected.
  </p>
  <p>
  One slow systems, deselecting <b>Color Display</b>, will speed things up but with reduced features.
  You can also alter the format of comments and variations, choosing
  to display them indented on a separate line for greater visibility.
  </p>

  <h3>Context Menu</h3>
  <ul>
     <li><term>Delete Variation:</term> Deletes the current variation </li>
     <li><term>Make First Variation:</term>
     Moves the current variation to the first position of all variations on that level </li>
     <li><term>Promote Variation to Mainline</term>
     Promotes the current variation to the mainline and demotes the
     current mainline to a variation.  </li>
     <li><term>Strip:Comments</term> Removes all comments </li>
     <li><term>Strip:Variations</term> Removes all variations </li>
     <li><term>Strip:Moves from the beginning</term> </li>

set helpTitle(PTracker) "Piece tracker"
set helpText(PTracker) {<h1>The Piece Tracker Window</h1>
  <p>
  The <term>Piece Tracker</term> is a tool that tracks the movements
  of a particular piece in all games in the current filter, and
  generates a "footprint" showing how often each square has been
  visited by the piece.
  </p>
  <p>
  To use the Piece Tracker, first make sure the filter contains the
  games you are interested in, such as games reaching a particular
  opening position or all games where a certain player had the white pieces.
  Then, select the piece to track and set other tracking options; these are
  explained below. Then press the <b>Update</b> button.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tracked piece movement information is displayed in two ways: a
  graphical "footprint", and a text list with one line of data per square.
  </p>

  <h3>Selecting the tracked piece</h3>
  <p>
  The chess pieces are displayed as in the standard chess starting position
  below the footprint chart. A single piece (such as the White b1 knight or
  the Black d7 pawn) can be selected with the left mouse button, and all
  pieces of the same type and color (such as all White pawns or both Black
  rooks) can be selected using the right mouse button.
  </p>

  <h3>Other piece tracker settings</h3>
  <p>
  The move number range controls when tracking should start and stop in
  each game. The default range of 1-20 (meaning tracking should stop after
  Black's 20th move) is appropriate for examining opening themes, but (for
  example) a range like 15-35 would be better when looking for middlegame
  trends.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are two types of statistic the tracker can generate:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>% games with move to square</b>: shows what proportion of filter
  games contain a move by the tracked piece to each square. This is
  the default setting and usually the most suitable choice.
  <li> <b>% time in each square</b>: shows the proportion of time the
  tracked piece has spent on each square.
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Hints</h3>
  <p>
  There are at least three good uses for the Piece Tracker: opening
  preparation, middlegame themes, and player preparation.
  </p>
  <p>
  For opening preparation, use the piece tracker with the <a Tree>Tree</a>
  opened. By tracking pieces you can see trends in the current opening
  such as common pawn pushes, knight outposts, and where the bishops are
  most often placed. You may find it useful to set the move number range
  to start after the current move in the game, so the moves made to reach
  the current position are not included in the statistics.
  </p>
  <p>
  For middlegame themes, the piece tracker can be useful when the filter
  has been set to contain a certain ECO range (using a
  <a Searches Header>Header search</a>) or perhaps a pattern such as a
  White IQP (using a <a Searches Material>Material/pattern search</a>).
  Set the move range to something suitable (such as 20-40), and track
  pieces to see pawn pushes in the late middlegame or early endgame,
  for example.
  </p>
  <p>
  For player preparation, use a <a Searches Header>Header search</a> or
  the <a PInfo>Player information</a> window to find all games by a
  certain player with one color. The Piece Tracker can then be used to
  discover how likely the player is to fianchetto bishops, castle
  queenside, or set up a d5 or e5 pawn wedge, for example.

<br>

</p>

}

set helpTitle(Tree) "Tree Window"
set helpText(Tree) {<h1>Tree Window</h1>
  <p>
  The <run ::tree::Open><green>Tree Window</green></run> is an powerful Scid
  feature. It shows the success rates of moves from the current
  position; in the form of statistics, and a tri-coloured graph representing
  white-wins, draws, and black-wins.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  Scid's Tree search is fast because of a novel idea - We
search for games that do not reached this position!
  </i></p>
  <h3>Opening a Tree</h3>
  <p>One can open a database and then select <b>Windows--<gt>Tree Window</b>,
  use the <b>Control-T</b> short-cut, or <b>Open Base as Tree</b> from the file menu.
  This last method means games in one database can be examined via the tree from a different database.</p>
  <h3>General Use</h3>
  <p>
  Clicking on a move adds that move to the game.
  </p>
  <p>
  The moves in the tree window can be sorted by
  Move (alphabetically), ECO code, Frequency, or Score.
  </p>
  <p>
  The "Adjust Filter" check-box will alter the gamelist so that only games matching the current position are displayed therein.
</p>
  <p><i>
  The Tree is updated whenever the main board changes. This can stress the CPU
  and be slow for large databases, but dynamic updates can be disabled by deselecting the "Refresh" check-box.
  </i></p>
  <p><i>Be wary of doing filter operations while the Tree Window is open,
  as the tree may override the filter. To perform searches, and open new bases,
it is best to close the Tree Window first.</i>
  </p>

  <h3>Statistics</h3>
  <p>
  The Tree Window shows statistics about the next move, as calulated from all games in the current base.
  The columns are:
  <br>
  <b>Move ECO Frequency Score AvElo Perf AvYear Draws</b>
  <br>
  The Score is always computed from white's perspective, so 100% means all White wins and 0% means all black
  wins.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Games with no result do not contribute to the percentage drawn, but as half-won/half-loss.</i>
  </p>
  <h3>Tree Masks</h3>
  <p> Tree Masks
  provide additional information beyond pure statistical data, and can be
  imagined as a transparent layer above the current tree that holds additional
  data. For more info see <a TreeMasks>here</a>.
  </p>
  </h3>
  <h3><name Best>Best Games Window</name></h3>
  <p>
  This button <button b_list> will show a list of
  highest-rated games for the current tree (shown in order of average rating).
  </p>
  <p>
  You can restrict the list to show games with a particular result.
  </p>

  <h3><name Lock>Locking the Tree Window</name></h3>
  <p>
  Each tree window is associated with a specific base, that is, if
  several bases are opened simultaneously, several tree windows may
  exist. If the <term>Lock</term> button in the tree window is
  enabled, closing the tree window will also close the database
  associated with this specific tree. Additionally, this also closes
  associated graph or best games windows. If the <term>Lock</term>
  button is not checked closing the tree will leave all these windows
  opened and just close the tree view of the base.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that opening a base as tree from the file menu will
  automatically lock the database by default.
  </p>

  <h3><name Training>Training</name></h3>
  <p>
  When the Training button <button tb_training> is selected,
  Scid will randomly make a move every time you add a move to the game.
  The move Scid chooses depends on database statistics, so a move played
  in 80% of database games will be chosen by Scid with 80% probability.
  Turning on this feature, then hiding (or iconifying) the Tree window and
  playing openings against a large database, is a great way to test your
  knowledge of your opening repertoire.
  </p>

  <h3>Caching for Faster Results</h3>
  <p>
  Scid maintains a cache of tree search results for the positions with the
  most matching games. If you move forward and back in a game in tree mode,
  you will see the tree window update almost instantly when the position
  being searched for is in the cache.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tree window has a file menu command named <term>Save Cache</term>.
  When you select this, the current contents of the tree cache in memory
  are written to a file (with the suffix <b>.stc</b>) to speed up future
  use of Tree mode with this database.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <term>Fill cache file</term> command in the file menu of the tree
  window fills the cache file with data for many opening positions.
  It does a tree search for about 100 of the most common opening positions,
  then saves the cache file.
  </p>
  <p>
  The maximum number of lines in the Cache can be configured by File /
  Cache size. The default are up to 1000 lines.
  </p>
  <p>
  Alternatively, one can fill the cache also with the content of a
  base or a game by choosing File / Fill Cache with base and File /
  Fill Cache with game, respectively. The cache will be filled with
  the contents of these including all variations. This is most helpful
  if one has one or more repertoire bases that can serve as input. 
  <p>
  Tree refresh can be dramatically enhanced if the database is sorted
  by ECO code then compacted (see the <a Maintenance>maintenance</a>
  window). Once this is achieved (the whole process can last several
  hours), turn on the option <term>Fast mode</term>. The refresh of
  the Tree window will be 20 times faster in average at the cost of
  some inaccuracies (games not in current filter will not be taken
  into account). By turning off the <term>Fast mode</term> option you
  will see the difference in the number of games when all the
  transpositions are taken into account.  If you want to get a preview
  of statistics then get a precise Tree, use the option <term>Fast and
  slow mode</term> 
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that a tree cache (.stc) file is completely redundant; you can remove
  it without affecting the database, and in fact it is removed by Scid
  whenever an action occurs that could leave it out of date; for example,
  adding or replacing a game, or sorting the database.

set helpTitle(TreeMasks) "Tree Masks"
set helpText(TreeMasks) {<h1>Tree Masks</h1>
  <p>
  The <a Tree>Tree window</a> displays information on all the moves in the
  database made from the current position.  <b>Masks</b> add additional
  information, and can be imagined as a transparent layer above the Tree that
  holds data such as commentaries for moves or positions, own
  evaluations, and ones opening repertoir.
  </p>
  <p>
  They are stored in a Mask file (<b>.stm</b> - Scid Tree Mask) and are independent of the
  databases to be used with. That is, one can create a
  Mask once and use it with any database by just
  loading it from the Tree Mask menu.
  </p>
  <p>
  When a Mask is opened, the display of
  the Tree window changes. First of all, all moves 
  present in the mask are highlighted in blue.
  Additionally, nags and markers are shown in front of a move, and
  Comments concerning the move are shown after the move.
  Finally, the current postition may also hold a comment.
  </p>
  <p>
  These items are all configurable by right-clicking the Tree.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>The indepencence of Masks from a database
  make them a very powerful tool for handling opening repertoirs.
  Contrary to the traditional way of opening lines, Masks
  have the advantage to handle transpositions transparently, simply
  because they are based on the current positions instead of a line
  leading to it.</i>
  </p>
  <h3>Using Masks</h3>
  <p>
  The Mask menu of the Tree widget is where Masks are opened or created.
  Once a Mask file is opened, commentary can be added 
  by right-clicking on the Tree, adding a move to the mask, and then 
  adding comments or nags. Moves existing in the Mask are displayed in blue.
  </p>
  <p>
  For an opening repertoir it might thus make sense to
  generate two masks, one for the White and one for the Black
  openings.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Moves not displayed in the Tree may be added to the Mask by means of 
  the lastmost context menus - "Add Move to Mask".</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  Don't forget to save the Mask! You will be prompted to do it
  if you close a Mask that has been modified or if a Tree Window is closed.
  </p>
  <h3>Configuring Masks</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><term>NAG</term> symbols are the simplest annotation symbol. The
  menu displays only those nags sensible for a move (not a position)
  which results in the following symbols possible <term>!!, !, !?, ?!,
  ?, ??, ~</term>
  </li>
<br>
  <li><term>Markers</term> (1 and 2) allow two graphical markers to be attached to a move. They
  are mainly meant to handle opening repertoirs. The available options
  are:
     <ul>
     <li> <img ::rep::_tb_include> Include line in repertoire</li>
     <li> <img ::rep::_tb_exclude> Exclude line from repertoire</li>
     <li> <img ::tree::mask::imageMainLine> Main Line</li>
     <li> <img tb_bkm> Bookmark</li>
     <li> <img ::tree::mask::imageWhite> White</li>
     <li> <img ::tree::mask::imageBlack> Black</li>
     <li> <img tb_new> New line</li>
     <li> <img tb_rfilter> To be verified by further analysis</li>
     <li> <img tb_msearch> To train</li>
     <li> <img tb_help> Dubious line</li>
     <li> <img tb_cut> To remove</li>
     </ul>
	  To remove a marker just select the item <b>No marker</b>.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><term>Color</term> Allows to add a little coloured square in
  front of the move for ones own highlighting. To remove it again
  select <b>White</b></li>
  <br>
  <li><term>Comment Move</term> allows to add a textual comment for
  the line. This comment is shown  right to the line it is
  associated. Note that only a part of the first line shows up there
  to give some visual feedback that commentary exists. The whole
  comment shows up in a tooltip once the mouse is moved over the line
  in question.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><term>Comment Position</term> can be used to add a comment for the
  current position. This comment is shown on top of Tree
  window once the commented position is reached. Note that Scid
  displays only the first line of the comment to save space in the
  Tree window. However, if the mouse is moved over that
  line the whole commentary shows up in a tooltip.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Mask Searches</h3>
  <p>
  <i>When using Mask Searches, enabling the Tree </i><b>Adjust Filter</b><i> check-box is recommended.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  The Mask Search feature enables searches for commentary, symbols etc.
  Selecting the <b>Search</b> button displays a list of all positions found 
  in FEN notation, followed by the move in question and commentary if any.
  </p>
  <h3>Mask Display</h3>
  <p>
  The Mask Display feature shows the current Mask in a line
  style. Starting at the current position all subsequent moves are
  sorted into some unfoldable tree to give an overview of the current
  lines of play - similar to what is found in many repertoir books.
  Not all information is displayed (e.g. Comments are
  shorted to fit the display). Additionally, as Masks
  work on positions rather than move sequences, they may contain loops
  (ie. transpositions) which can't be properly unfolded in a line wise
  display. i.e this display may be cut at a certain point.
  </p>
  <h3>Conversion to Masks</h3>
  <p>
  Setting up a mask can be a tedious task, especially for complex
  opening repertoirs. However, if such a repertoir is available as a
  Scid Database or a number of PGN games, or lines stored in usual
  chess games, Scid can use that information to set up suitable
  Masks automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
  First of all one has to load the information into a Scid Database.
  In case the information is already available as a Scid Database this
  is as easy as opening it. In case a PGN file is use it should be
  either imported into a Scid Database or one can use the
  Clipbase to import it temporarily (In which case one
  should make sure the Clipbase is empty before
  importing).
  </p>
  <p>
  The next step is to open the tree for the just opened Scid Database.
  Then a new Mask should be created or an existing one
  opened. <i>This function may be used to consolidate
  serveral bases into a single Mask</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now, the Mask can be filled automatically with the game content of the
  database. In this process, comments within the games will be converted to move
  comments (appending to those existing eventually) in the Mask. NAGs will be
  added as well. To initiate this process one can chose either <b>Fill with
  game</b> to fill the Mask with the contents of a single game, or <b>Fill with
  Database</b> to loop over all games in the database.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Note</b> filling a Mask with an entire base can be quite time consuming.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Note</b> The Mask is filled with all moves till the
  end of the game including all variations within a game. Therefore,
  it is sensible to use only bases for this procedure that end the
  games as soon as the middle game is reached.

set helpTitle(Compact) "Database compaction"
set helpText(Compact) {<h1>Database Compaction</h1>
  <p>
  Database <term>compaction</term> is a specific type of
  <a Maintenance>maintenance</a> that keeps a database as small and
  efficient as possible.
  It involves removing any unused space in its files.
  There are two types: Name File and Game File compaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Name File Compaction</h3>
  <p>
  Over time, you may find a database starts to contain a number of player,
  event, site or round names that are no longer used in any game. This will
  often happen after you spellcheck names. The unused names waste space in
  the name file, and can slow down name searches.
  Name File compaction removes all names that are not used in any games.
  </p>

  <h3>Game File Compaction</h3>
  <p>
  Whenever a game is replaced or deleted, wasted space is left in the game
  file (the largest of the three files in a Scid Database). Game File
  compaction removes all wasted space, leaving no deleted games in the
  database. Note that this operation is irreversible: after compaction,
  the deleted games are gone forever!
  </p>
  <p>
  Game File compaction is also recommended after <a Sorting>sorting</a> a
  database, to keep the order of the game file consistent with the sorted
  Index File.
  </p>

  <p><footer>Updated: Scid vs. PC 4.3, December 2010</footer></p>
}


set helpTitle(Maintenance) "Database Maintenance"
set helpText(Maintenance) {<h1>Database Maintenance</h1>
  <p>
  Most Scid Database maintenance can be done from the
<green><run ::maint::Open>Maintenance Window</b></run></green>
  (control+m).
  You can use this window to maintain <a Flags>game flags</a>,
  <a Maintenance Spellcheck>spellcheck</a> names,
  compact, and sort databases.
  </p><p>
  <i>Note - operations that are not available
  for the current database (for eg, because it may be read-only,
  or a PGN file) will be grayed out</i>.
  </p>

  <h3>Compaction and Sorting</h3>
  <p>
<a Compact>Compaction</a> and <a Sorting>Sorting</a> features are documented separately.
  </p>
  <h3><name Twins>Deleting Twin Games</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <run markTwins><green>Delete Twin Games</green></run>
  feature facilitates removal of duplicate
  games from the database.  It identifies twins
  and flags one as deleted.
  <i>To actually delete the games, you must compact the database.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  Two games are considered twins if their Players, and
  any other tags that you specify, exactly match.
  If you specify the "Same moves" option (strongly recommended)
  each pair must have the
  same moves; up to the length of the shorter game , or
  60 moves maximum.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you have identified twins, it is good practise
  to confirm they have been correctly marked.
  Selecting "Set filter to twins to be deleted" 
  ensures the filter contains the deleted games,
  and you can browse through them  with the <b>Twin Game Checker</b> window,
  (which automatically appears). Here, tag differences are highlighted, and
  Scid vs. PC also shows a inline comparison of game variations and comments.
  </p>
  <p>
  Use the Arrow Keys to progress through the games, "1", "2" and "t" keys to
  toggle the Delete Fields, and "u" to Undelete both games.
  </p>

  <h3><name Editing>Editing Names</name></h3>
  <p>
  The 
  <run nameEditor><green>Name Editor</green></run>
  is a tool to selectively edit entity names.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each unique name is only stored once in the <a Formats>name file</a>, so changing a name
  actually changes all occurrences of it. Similarly, some names in the name file may not actually be used. To remove such names, 
perform a Namebase <a Compact>Compaction</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  An single asterisk '*' may be used to match <b>any</b> name. This global substitution is only available for 
  the EVENT, SITE and ROUND names - not the PLAYER, ELO or DATE names.
  </p>
  <p>
  DATE and EVENTDATE fields must be of the form YYYY.MM.DD (year, month, day)
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Please take care when using the Name Editor. Changes are not properly undoable if the "With" name already exists. There is also a safety mechanism - Using '*' or '?' is not allowed with 'All games in database'.</i>
  </p>

  <h3><name Spellfile>Spell Check File</name></h3>
  <p>
  The spellcheck file <b>spelling.ssp</b> contains information about Player Names, Titles, Birth & Death dates, and Country(s) of origin.
  <b>Please use with caution</b>. The names it contains may not be
  unique, and player initials may be incorrectly identified.
  It is also possible to substitute the larger <b>ratings.ssp</b>, which additionally includes Elo ratings and FIDE Biographical data.
  </p>
  <p>
  The file should be loaded on startup, or can be <run
  readSpellCheckFile><green>loaded manually</green></run>.<i>
  Updated versions are available at
  <url http://linweb.ris.at/~nagl/index.html>http://linweb.ris.at/~nagl/index.html</url>.
  </i></p>
  
  <h3><name Spellcheck>Spell Checking</name></h3>
  <p>
  Scid's Spell Checking feature is used to standardize <b>Player</b>, <b>Event</b>, <b>Site</b> and <b>Round</b> names throughout a database.
  To do so, the <a Maintenance Spellfile>spelling.ssp</a> file must be loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
  When Spell Check is run, a list of proposed corrections is produced. These
  should be perused and edited before actually making the corrections on disk.
  <i>The normal keyboard shortcuts for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo apply</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The format of each correction is:
  <br><b>"Old Name" <gt><gt> "New Name"</b> (<b>N</b>) <b>Birthdate</b>--<b>Deathdate</b><br>
  There should be no space before "Old Name", and "N" represents the number of games matching the original player name.
  </p>
  <p>
  One may discard any correction by deleting it, or adding a
  space or any other character at the start of the line.  Player names with a
  <b>surname only</b> do not get corrected by default.
  Simliarly , <b>Ambiguous</b> name substitutions are not performed unless one
  manually removes the Ambiguous prefix from each line.
  </p>
  <p>
  Name substitution will not occur in games dated before the Player's birth, or after death - unless the birth and death dates are removed from the translation.
  </p>

  <h3><name Ratings>Adding Elo Ratings to Games</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <b>Add Elo ratings</b> button (Maintenance window) searches for games with null player ratings.
  If the spellcheck file has an ELO rating for the
  player - at the date of the game - Scid will add such ratings to the database.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <a Maintenance Spellfile>spellcheck file</a> provided with Scid does not contain
  the Elo rating information needed for this function. Instead,
  the larger <b>ratings.ssp</b> file should be used.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Ratings are not added to games with known aliases.
  One may wish to run the Spell Checker first, which changes names using player aliases.
  </i>
  </p>


  <h3><name Cleaner>The Cleaner</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <run cleanerWin><green>Cleaner</green></run> window
  is a tool for doing a number of maintenance tasks at one time.
  You can choose which tasks you want to do, and Scid will
  perform them on the current database without requiring user interaction.
  This is especially useful for maintenance of large databases.
  </p>

  <h3><name Autoload>Autoloading a Game</name></h3>
  <p>
  When a database is opened, one may automatically load a particular game
  using the Maintenance <b>Autoload game</b> feature. 
  <i>Note: Because of design of si4 header, this number's upper limit is 16,777,214 (Approximately 2^(8*3)).</i>
  </p>

  <h3><name Tags>Strip PGN Tags</name></h3>
  <p>
  This feature scans the database for extra PGN tags (such as "Annotator").
  Then, one may strip these tags from the base, or set the filter to
  show the matching games.
  </p>

  <h3><name Check>Check Games</name></h3>
  <p>
  This feature performs basic checks on every game/filter games.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each Game 
  <br>
  * Has index entry fetched
  <br>
  * Read from disk
  <br>
  * And is Decoded.
  </p>
  <p>
  Any errors are reported.
  </p>

  <h3>Repair a Base</h3>
  <p>
  In the rare cases that a Scid Database is corrupted one might try to
  repair it using File--<gt>Maintanance--<gt>Repair base. For this to work,
  the base in question must not be opened (which is not possible in
  most cases anyway). Scid will then try its best to get the database
  back in a consistent and usable state.

set helpTitle(Sorting) "Sorting a database"
set helpText(Sorting) {<h1>Sorting Databases</h1>
  <p>
  Scid has a fast and powerful <run makeSortWin><green>Sort Database</green></run>
  feature. Sorts can be performed on single fields (eg: Dates, Names and ECO codes),
  or multiple fields, with the first field having priority, and so-on.
  </p>

  <p>
  The available criteria/fields are
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li> Date (oldest games first)
  <li> Year (same as date, but using the year only)
  <li> Event name
  <li> Site name
  <li> Country (last 3 letters of Site name)
  <li> Round name
  <li> White name
  <li> Black name
  <li> Rating (average of White and Black ratings, highest first)
  <li> Result
  <li> Length (number of full moves in the game)
  <li> ECO (<a ECO>Encyclopedia of Chess Openings code</a>)
  <li> Variations (number of variations in game)
  <li> Comments (number of comments in game)
  </ul>

  <h3>Sorting is Permanent</h3>
  <p>
  When you sort a database (which is not read-only) the
  results are saved immediately and the <b>order of games is
  permanently changed</b>.  If this is not desired,
  one may first make the database <b>read-only<b> from the
  <a Maintenance>maintenance</a> window.
  </p>
  <p>
  When sorting a read-only database (or PGN archive)
  , the results cannot be saved and the order of games
  is lost when the file is closed.
  </p>

  <h3>Database Performance</h3>
  <p>
  When a database is sorted the Index File is altered but the Game File
  is not (leaving the game file records out of order relative to the Index File).
  This can result in slow <a Tree>tree</a>, position and material/pattern
  <a Searches>searches</a>. After sorting, one should reorder the game file by
  <a Compact>compacting</a> it to maintain good search performance.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionaly, only databases sorted by <a ECO>ECO</a> codes (and subsequently
compacted) can use <b>fast tree searches<b>.

set helpTitle(Flags) "Game Flags"
set helpText(Flags) {<h1>Game Flags</h1>

  <p>
  Game Flags are indicators of some characteristic, such as <b>Brilliant Play</b> or <b>White Opening</b>.
  There are <b>12 user flags</b> and <b>6 custom flags</b>
  , and they're especially useful for enabling fast database searches.</p>

<p>Additionally, files may be marked with the special-case <b>Delete Flag</b>. This
  indicates they will be removed when the database it is next <a Compact>compacted</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  The 12 user flags are
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>W - White opening</li>
  <li>B - Black opening</li>
  <li>M - Middlegame</li>
  <li>E - Endgame</li>
  <li>N - Novelty</li>
  <li>P - Pawn structure</li>
  <li>T - Tactics</li>
  <li>Q - Queenside play</li>
  <li>K - Kingside play</li>
  <li>! - Brilliancy</li>
  <li>? - Blunder</li>
  <li>U - User-defined</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The 6 custom flags (1 to 6) can be given any lable up to eight characters long.
  </p>

  <p>
  User and Custom flags are set in the <a Maintenance>Maintenance
  Window</a>. Scid vs. PC also allows quick flag tagging via the <a
  GameList>Game List</a> window.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can use a <a Searches Header>Header Search</a> to find all
  games in a database that have a particular flag turned on or off,
  or use flags as part of more complex searches.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since all the user flags (except Delete) have
  no special significance, one may use them for any purpose.
  For example, you could use the Kingside (K)
  flag for kingside pawn storms, or kingside heavy piece attacks,
  or even for endgames with all pawns on the kingside.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note, sensible handling of flags can speed up searches significantly!
  </p>
  <p>
  The following functions of Scid set or require flags:
  <ul>
     <li><a Analysis Annotate>Find best move</a>: evaluates the (T) flag
     <li><a Analysis Annotate>Find tactical exercise</a>: sets the (T) flag
  </ul>

set helpTitle(Analysis) "Analysis Window"
set helpText(Analysis) {<h1>Analysis Windows</h1>

  <p> Scid vs. PC has powerful chess analysis features. Multiple engines can be
run at any one time; they can be matched against each other in <a
Tourney>Computer Tournaments</a>, and log files can be browsed from within the app -
making for easier <a Analysis Debugging>Debugging</a>.
</p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <p>A few engines come preinstalled, while others can be added via the <a
  Analysis List>Engine Configuration</a> window.</p>

  <p>Starting them can be done in various ways
  By <run ::startAnalysisWin F2><green>pressing F2</green></run>
  , F3 or F4 from the Configuration Widget, or via the <b>Tools--<gt>Start Engine</b> menu.
  Additionally, Engine 1 can be start/stopped by <b>double-clicking the statusbar</b>.
  Right-clicking the Statusbar will dock/undock the engine,
  which, when running docked, will run at low CPU priority.<p>

  <p>
  <b>Space Bar</b> is bound to engine start/stop, and pressing <b>Enter</b> will add the engine's current best move.
  </p>
  <p>
  At the top of the window are some useful Buttons.
  <a Analysis Moves>Engine Analysis</a> occupy most of the space,
  and at the bottom is some <a Analysis Info>Extra Information</a> (which may be hidden).
  </p>

  <p>
  <i>The analysis output has three modes: No wrap, Word wrap, and Hidden.
  These are toggled between by right-clicking the analysis window.</i>
  </p>

  <h3><name Buttons>Buttons</h3>
  <p>
  At the top you'll find many cryptic buttons...
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> <button tb_pause 32> <b>Pause</b>  temporarily interrupt engine analysis.</li>
  <li> <button tb_play 32> <b>Play</b>  restarts the engine.
  <i>Note: This will cause most engines 
  to restart their analysis, forgetting previous lines.
  Only few engines are able to reuse the
  results they have calculated till the analysis was stopped.</i> </li>
  <li> <button tb_lockengine 32> <b>Lock Analysis</b> to a certain position.
  Hover cursor over this button to see stats for locked game.
  After a while, to add this analysis to game, return to the locked position, 
  press Pause, Unlock, and Add Variation.</li>

  <li> <button tb_addmove 32> <b>Add Move</b> 
  adds the engine's best move to the current game.  (Right clicking adds the Engine Score).</li>
  <li> <button tb_addvar 32> <b>Add Variation</b>  adds the whole main line.  (Right clicking adds the second variation if multi-pv enabled)</li>
  <li> <button tb_addallvars 32> <b>Multi-PV</b>  if the engine supports multi-pv, add all principal variations.</li>

  <li> <button tb_info 32> <b>Show Info</b> show additional information.</li>
  <li> <button tb_cpu 32> <b>Low CPU priority</b> 
  give the engine a low priority for CPU
  scheduling. On Windows, engines are run on low priority by default.
  On Unix systems the engines priority can not be set back to normal.  </li>
  <li> <button tb_coords 32> <b>Show Board</b> displays a small working board.
  If engine is locked, the board displays the locked position.</li>
  <li> <button autoplay_off 32> <b>Shoot out</b>, or "demo", mode allows the engine to play out the game. </li>
  <li> <button tb_annotate 32> <b>Annotate</b> game (see below).</li>
  <li> <button tb_training 32> <b>Training</b> feature (see below).</li>
<br>
  <li> And for Xboard engines only:</li>
  <li> <button tb_update 32> <b>Update</b> gets the engine to display a statistics line,
with the format "stat01: time nodes ply mvleft mvtot mvname". The results can be found in the engine's log file.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3><name Moves>Moves</name></h3>
  <p>
  Each line of the main text widget contains an <b>Engine Analysis Info</b>.
  The first number is the current <b>Search Depth</b>. The next (prefixed with
  a +/-), is a <b>Move Score</b>.  It is measured in pawn units from the
  perspective of white - a positive score means white is ahead, a negative score
  means black. Then follows the move predictions.  </p>
  <p>
  Many recent <term>UCI</term> engines also allow to analyse several lines at
  once. Using this <term>Multi-PV</term> feature, the user can see the second or
  third (etcetera) best continuations.  The best line is always on top and
  highlighted.  If an engine allows for <term>Multi-PV analysis</term>, the spin
  box can be used to set the number of principal variations shown.  In this case,
  instead of the calculation history, only the resulting principal lines are
  shown. The spin box is disabled if an engine does offer this feature.
  </p>

  <h3><name Info>Extra Information</h3>
  <p>
  At the bottom is some additional technical info. If this is hidden, it
  can been seen by pressing the <b>Engine Info</b> button.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Depth</b>: the search depth already reached by
  the engines calculations (in half moves).
  <br><b>Nodes</b>: the number of positions analysed for the current
  result (and the number of positions per second).
  <br><b>Time</b>: the amount of time spent for the current analysis.
  </p><p>
  Additional information includes the number of tablebase hits, a
  more exact number of nodes analysed per second, the watermark of the
  engines hash and the current CPU load.
  </p>

  <h1>Features</h1>

  <h3><name Annotating>Annotating Games</name></h3>
  <p>
  Games can be automatically analysed using
  the Annotate Button <button tb_annotate> (in the <a Analysis>Analysis Engine</a> toolbar).
  This feature adds Scores, <a Comment>Comments</a>, <a Moves Informant>Informants</a>,
  and Bestlines to games.</p>

  <p>After configuring the options and pressing OK, Autoplay
  Mode is enabled and the engine starts its analysis.
  A variation and/or score is
  automatically added for each position as the engine processes the game.
  Only positions from the current position until the end of the game
  are annotated, so you can skip annotation of opening moves
  by moving to a mid-game position before starting.
  To cancel annotation at any time, turn off Autoplay Mode
  </p>
  <p><i>
  The Annotate feature of Scid vs. PC can be used with any engine,
  but be sure not to open other Analysis Windows while annotation is in progress.

  <h3>Training</h3>
  <p>
  The Training Button <button tb_training> (only available for engines 1 and 2) allows
  one to play against the engine.  The engine moves first (from the current position) and may be stopped
  by pressing the button again.
  The time for each move is fixed, and analysis results are not updated while training mode is on.
  </p>

  <h2><name List>Configuring Engines</name></h2>
  <p>
  The <run ::enginelist::choose><green>Tools--<gt>Analysis Engines</green></run>
  widget is where you can <b>Configure</b>, <b>Add</b>, and <b>Start</b> Chess Engines.
  </p>

<p>
  Scid vs. PC installs a few engines by default. To install new ones you'll need to know
  the program's <b>Command</b>, any <b>Parameters</b> it takes,
  whether it is uses the <b>UCI or Xboard</b> protocol, and also the
  <b>Directory</b> it should be run in.
  This sounds complicated, but is not too hard :-)
  Sticking points are likely to be the choice of
  which directory to use, and whether it's UCI or not.</p>

  <h3>Details</h3>
<p> Many engines require an
  initialization or opening book file in their start directory to run
  properly.  Other engines, like Crafty and Phalanx, write log files to the
  directory they start in, so write access will be required.
  If the directory setting for an engine
  is ".", Scid will just start the engine in the current directory.
  </p>

  <p>
  If an engine fails to start, try
  changing its directory setting. To avoid engines creating log files
  in many different directories, I recommend trying the <b>~/.scdivspc</b>
  button. Engines necessitating opening books and/or .ini files, will need
  a directory of their own however.
  </p>
  <p>
  UCI and Xboard (also known as Winboard) are two protocols
  for communicating with engines, and it is necessary to set this flag accordingly.
  If you're not sure, try one then the other, as nothing will break. Some chess
engines support both formats.
  </p>
  <p>
  If an engine needs additional parameters for startup (e.g. a
  specific opening book) they can be specified in the
  <b>Parameters</b> field. ... Please refer to the engines documentation.
  </p>
  <p><b>Webpage</b> allows you to set the engines homepage. This
  comes in handy to check for updates e.g. or to have a look at recent
  developments. Pressing the <term>Open...</term> button will open
  this page in the web browser.
  </p>

  <h2><name UCI>UCI Configuration Options</name></h2>

  <p>
  UCI Engines can be configured by pressing <button uci> or <b>Configure</b> in the Edit Window, whence
  a dialog with the engines parameters will be shown. Gilles will write a big help section here ;<gt>
  </p>

  <h2><name Debugging>Debugging Engine Crashes</name></h2>
  <p>
  If an engine fails to start, or crashes, one may examine it's log file.
  These are kept in the Scidvspc's log directory and can be viewed
via the <button tb_annotate> button in the <run ::enginelist::choose><green>engine configuration</green></run> widget.

set helpTitle(Tourney) "Computer Tournament"
set helpText(Tourney) {<h1>Computer Tournament</h1>

  <p>
  Automated <run ::compInit><green>Computer Tournaments</green></run>
  can be run with any XBoard or UCI engine installed via the
  <a Analysis List>Analysis Engines</a> widget.
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Support for different engines is good, but some older xboard engines don't work well.
  For more information about engine compatibility, see below.
  </i></p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>

  <p>
  First, select the details of your tournament. Configurable items include:
  the <b>Number of Competitors</b>, <b>Tournament Name</b>, <b>Time-Control Method</b> and <b>Period</b>.
  If using the per-game time control, <b>Show Clocks</b> will display the engine's remaining time.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time per Game</b> is the best time control method.
  The minutes spinbox is the base time for the game, while the seconds spinbox
  is the increment. For example, to play a 10 second game with .1 sec increment, the values are
  .17 minutes and .1 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time per Move</b> games allow a generous time slice, and only forfeits an engine if it takes over 175%
  of its nominal move period.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Permanent Thinking</b> allows engines to play at their strongest.
  For UCI engines, it enables pondering, and sets Xboard engines to hard mode.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Use book</b> gives UCI engines access to polyglot opening books, enabling a greater variety
  of play. Book moves are selected in frequency according to their weight.
</p>
<p>
  Scid's GUI does use more resources than other tournament managers, so, for short time controlled games,
  it is good practice to disable engine logs, move animations, and to hide the clocks, gameinfo and pgn windows.
</p>
<p>
  The Tournament currently doesn't support opening books - though many
  engines enable private opening books (unless disabled via the UCI config widget).
  </p>
  <p>
  Games are <b>saved after each is completed</b>, so open an appropriate base, or just
  use the Clipbase. When the tournament is over, press "Close".
  </p>
  <p>
  If a game drags on for any reason, three buttons allow for <b>manual adjudication</b>.
  The <b>Pause Game</b> button does not take effect instantaneously, but first waits for the current move to be made before pausing further progress.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  Once the tournament is completed, be sure to have a look at the 
  <run ::crosstab::Open><green>Crosstable</green></run> window
  to see the results summary.
  </i></p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
<br>
  * Engine scores (and times) can be stored as comments by enabling "set comp(showscores) 1" in the GUI.
<br><br>
  * Updating Scid's interface does take some CPU activity, but effort is made to not include this time in each engine's time-slice.
  Additionally, the Clock Widgets> take a small CPU slice - around .0005 seconds per move on my 2600MHz Core2Quad.
<br>
  <h3>Todo</h3>
<br>
  * Move options to a menu Options-<gt>Tournament
<br>
  <h3>Engines</h3>
<p>
The author has tested quite a few engines under Linux, and a lesser number with Windows and Macs. These include:
<br>
<br>
Arasanx<br>
Chenard<br>
Crafty<br>
Critter<br>
Faile<br>
Gaviota<br>
Glaurung<br>
Gnu Chess 5<br>

Hoi Chess<br>
Homer<br>
Ivanhoe<br>
Komodo<br>
Marvin<br>
OliThink<br>
Phalanx<br>
Red Queen<br>
RobboLito<br>
Scidlet<br>
Scorpio<br>
Shredder Classic 4<br>
Sjeng<br>
Sloppy<br>
Spike<br>
Stockfish<br>
Strelka 5<br>
Toga (Fruit)<br>
Umko 1.1<br>
Zct<br>
<br>
Komodo performs well, but some versions have broken time-per-move time control.
Pervious versions of Phalanx had no time control, but it now works well.
Gnuchess may need the "-x" parameter to work in xboard mode (but recent versions also support UCI),
and only versions > 5.07 will properly handle time-per-game time control.
Faile seems not to work well with time-per-move.
Arasanx UCI <lt>= 14.1 does not work with Permanent Thinking.

set helpTitle(CalVar) "Calculation of variation"
set helpText(CalVar) {<h1>Calculation of Variations</h1>
  <p>
   This training exercise (also known as the <b>Stoyko Exercise</b>)
   involves analysing a complex position, to find and evaluate as many sound
   lines as possible.
  </p> 
  <p>
  Configuration is fairly straight-forward, and involves
  <ul>
     <li>* The UCI engine to use</li>
     <li>* <b>Initial thinking time</b> - seconds for the engine to analyse the position</li>
     <li>* <b>Variation thinking time</b> - seconds for the engine to analyse each variation entered by the user</li>
  </ul>
  Clicking Start begins the exercise.
  </p>

  <p>
  After the engine's initial thinking time, the "Done with Position" button will become active,
  and the player should click on the board to enter a variation.
  <i>The board is not responsive, but moves are instead entered into the text widget.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  To finalise the move, one should click one of the NAG codes buttons.
  The engine will evaluate the move, after which the user may enter more good moves.
  When the user has finished entering thier best moves, click
  <b>Done with position</b>. The engine will append (any) misssed lines to the game PGN.
  </p>
  <h4>Bugs</h4>
  <p>This feature does not work from within an existing variation, of at the end of a game.
  Program flow probably needs refining too.

set helpTitle(EPD) "EPD files"
set helpText(EPD) {<h1>EPD Files</h1>
  <p>
  An <b>Extended Position Description</b> file is a text file with chess positions;
  each having some associated text.
  <br>
  Like <a PGN>PGN</a>, it is a common standard for chess information.
  </p>
  <p>
  EPD files contain <a EPD opcodes>Opcodes</a> , or fields, which are separated by semicolons in the file,
  but shown on separate lines in Scid's EPD Window.
  (Semicolons within an EPD field are stored as "<b>\s</b>" to distinguish them from end-of-field markers).
  They have a number of uses. Scid uses an EPD file to classify
  games according to the <a ECO>ECO</a> system, and you can create an EPD file for your opening repertoire,
  adding comments for positions you regularly reach in games [Feature removed].
  </p>
  <p>
  At most four EPD files can be open at any time.
  </p>

  <h3>Navigating EPD files</h3>
  <p>
  To browse the positions in an EPD file, use  the <b>Control+Down</b>,
  <b>Control+Up</b>, <b>Control+Home</b> or <b>Control+End</b> keys.
  These commands move to the next/previous position in the file, clearing
  the current game and setting its start position.
  </p>

  <h3>Annotating</h3>
  <p>
  EPD files can be automatically annotated by the <b>Tools--<gt>Annotate Positions</b> menu.
  A dialogue will ask for the Analysis Time 
  , and the first analysis engine will start.
  The EPD tags used are <b>acd</b>, <b>acn</b>, <b>ce</b> and <b>pv</b>.
  </p>

  <h3>Stripping out EPD fields</h3>
  <p>
  EPD files you find on the Internet may contain fields that do not
  interest you, and they can waste a lot of space in the file.
  For example, an EPD file of computer evaluations might have ce, acd,
  acn, pm, pv and id fields but you may only need the ce and pv fields.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can strip out an EPD opcode from all positions in the EPD file using
  the <b>Tools--<gt>Strip out EPD field</b> menu.
  </p>

  <h3>The EPD window status bar</h3>
  <p>
  The status bar of each EPD window shows:
  <ul>
  <li>- the file status (<b>--</b> means unchanged, <b>XX</b> means
  changed, and <b>%%</b> means read-only); </li>

set helpTitle(Email) "Email window"
set helpText(Email) {<h1>The Email Window</h1>
  <p>
  The Email Window provides basic support for correspondence games played by email.
  One may send messages directly from Scid, but you still need to manually add your opponents moves as
  there is no capability to check your email folder.
  </p>
  <p><i>Email settings are database dependant, and are stored in the same directory as the si4 file, with an .sem file extension.</i></p>
  <p>
  To use the email manager:
  <ul>
  <li><b>1)</b> Create the game(s) for your opponent in the
  database. </li>
  <li><b>2)</b> In the email manager window, select <b>Add</b> and enter
  your opponents details: name, email address, and the game numbers (separated by spaces) in the
  database. </li>
  <li><b>3)</b> Select <b>Send email</b> in the email window each time you
  have added moves to the game(s) and want to send a message. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  When you send an email message, Scid generates the message with the games
  in PGN format <b>without</b> any comments, annotations or variations, since
  you would not usually want your opponent to see your analysis.
  You can edit the message before sending it to add conditional moves or
  other text.
  </p>
  <p>
  For each opponent, you may have any number of games; one or two is most
  common. Note that Scid does not check if game numbers change, so after
  setting up the details of your opponents, be careful to avoid deleting games
  or sorting your database of email games, since this will rearrange games
  and the game numbers for each opponent will be incorrect.
  </p>

  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>
  A copy of each email message sent by Scid is stored in the file
  <b>~/.scid/scidmail.log</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid can send email messages using an SMTP server or sendmail.
  User the <b>Settings</b> button in the Email Manager to specify which
  you want to use.

set helpTitle(Reports) "Reports"
set helpText(Reports) {<h1>Reports</h1>
  <p>
  Scid can generate two types of reports: Opening and <a Reports Player>Player Reports</a>.
  </p>

  <h3><name Opening>Opening Reports</name></h3>
  <p>
  Scid's <run ::optable::makeReportWin><green>Opening Report</green></run> display interesting facts about the current position.
  The first sections of the report have information on games
  matching the position, and moves played thereafter. One can
  see if the opening is becoming more popular, if it has many short draws,
  and what move orders (transpositions) are used to reach it.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Positional Themes section reports the frequency of certain common
  positional themes in the report games. For this, the first 20 moves of
  each game (hence the first 40 positions of each game after the starting
  position) are examined. To be counted as containing a theme, a game must
  contain that particular theme in at least 4 positions of its first 20
  moves. This avoids the brief occurrence of a theme (such as an isolated
  Queen pawn which is quickly captured) distorting results.
  </p>
  <p>
  The final and largest part of the report is the Theory Table. When saving
  the report to a file, you can choose to save just the table, a compact
  report without the table, or the whole report.
  </p>
  <p>
  Almost all the report sections can be turned on or off, or adjusted, in
  the Opening Report Options. So you can customize a report to only show
  the information that interests you.
  </p>
  <p>
  Most coloured items in the report window are clickable, and
  invoke some relevant action. For example; clicking a game reference
  will load that game, or clicking a positional theme will set the filter
  to contain only the report games where that theme occurred.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>Merge Games</b> button merges all games from the
  Opening Report into the current game as variations, including the full reference.
  </p>

  <h4><name Favorites>Favorites</name></h4>
  <p>
  The <b>Favorites Menu</b> in the Report Window allows one to maintain a
  collection of favorite opening positions.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Add Report</b> adds the current position as a favourite, and
  <b>Generate Reports</b> generates a report
  for each of these favorites. A dialog-box
  will appear allowing you to specify the report type and format, and
  a directory where report files will be saved. A suitable suffix for the
  format you selected (e.g. ".html" for HTML format) will be added to each
  report file name.
  </p>

  <h3><name Player>Player Reports</name></h3>
  <p>
  Player Reports are very similar to
  <a Reports Opening>Opening Reports</a>, but 
  contain information about the games of a single player - with the white or
  black pieces. One can generate a Player Report from
  <run ::preport::preportDlg><green>Tools-<gt>Player Report</green></run>
  or from the <a PInfo>Player Info</a> window.
  </p>
  <p>
  Player Reports can be generated for all games (with the specified player and pieces),
  or for games matching the current position.
  </p>

  <h3>Limits</h3>
  <p>
  There is a limit of 2000 games for most data generated by reports, so
  if the report position occurs in more than 2000 games, some results may
  be slightly incorrect.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, there is a limit of 500 games for the Theory Table. If the report
  position occurs in more than 500 games, only 500 games with the highest
  average Elo are used to generate the Theory Table. You can adjust the
  number of games used to generate the table, in the Report Options.

set helpTitle(PInfo) "Player Information"
set helpText(PInfo) {<h1>Player Information</h1>
  <p>

  The Player Information window shows basic information when available.
  It draws upon the <a Maintenance Spellfile>spelling.ssp file</a>,
  and includes Ratings, Country of Origin,  Official Titles and even Photos.</p>

  <p><b>Please use with caution</b>. <i>The names it contains may not be
  unique, and player initials may be incorrectly identified. Mainline SCID uses a
  more specific name match algorithm - which is less useful - but also less likely
  to make erroneous matches.  The larger </i><b>ratings.ssp</b><i> file (which may be
substituted), includes FIDE IDs and biographical data which help clarify unique
players.
</i></p>

  <p>Also displayed are statistics about
  success with white and black, favorite openings (by <a ECO>ECO code</a>),
  and rating history.
  All percentages displayed are an expected score (success rate), from the
  player's perspective -- so higher is always better for the player, whether they
  are White or Black.
  Clicking the numbers displayed in green will set the <a Filter>filter</a>
  according to the statistic it represents.
  </p>

  <h4>Features</h4>
  <p>
  You can see a player's rating history by pressing 
  <a Graphs Rating>Rating Graph</a> , and perform rating assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are also buttons to help browse similar Player Names, 
  perform <a Maintenance Editing>name substitutions</b> in the whole (or part) database, or run the 
  <a Reports Player>Player Report</a> feature.
  </p>

<h3><name Photos>Player Photos</name></h3>
<p>To enable player photos, download "FIDE.spf" from the 
<url http://scid.sourceforge.net/download.html>Scid download page</url>,
and install it into Scid vs. PC's user directory.
On Linux and Macs this is "$HOME/.scidvspc", or the application directory on Windows.
The <green>Help--<gt>Startup Window</green> will help you find it's location, and
will also indicate if the photo file has been loaded correctly.
</p>
<p>Once installed, available player photos are shown in the <a MainWindow GameInfo>game information</a> widget.
Clicking on the photos makes them smaller. To disable them, deselect <green>Options--<gt>Game Information--<gt>Show Photos</green>.

set helpTitle(Graphs) "Graph windows"
set helpText(Graphs) {<h1>Graph Windows</h1>
  <p>
  Scid has a number of graph features, displaying information about Player Ratings, Game Frequencies and Score Evaluation.
  </p>

  <h3><name Filter>Filter Graph Windows</name></h3>
<p>
  <b>Relative Filter Graph</b>
  <p>
  The <green><run ::tools::graphs::filter::Open>Relative Filter Graph</run></green> shows trends by Date,
  Elo Rating or Moves for games in the current filter compared to the
  entire database. For example; when the <a Tree>tree</a>
  is open it shows how the current opening has changed
  in popularity in recent years, or whether it is especially
  popular among higher-rated players.
  Each point on the graph represents the number of games in the filter
  per 1000 games in the entire database, for a particular date or Elo
  rating range.
  </p><p>
  <b>Absolute Filter Graph</b>
  <p>
  The <green><run ::tools::graphs::absfilter::Open>Absolute Filter Graph</run></green> 
  shows the quantity of games in the filter according to the selected criteria.
</p><p>
<b>Usage</b>
  <p>
  The iconic button near the bottom opens a dialog to configure
  the graph. You can select the range and interval for the X axis. The "Decade" criteria can't be configured,
  use "Year" instead. If "Estimate" is selected, a missing rating will be
  estimates as described below. Otherwise no estimation is done
  and missing ratings are count as zero. This matches the Min. Elo
  evaluation in the statistic-window.</p>
  <p>
  <i>Note: the calculation can take some time on large ranges and
  small intervals</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
  When plotting the Filter graph by rating, Scid uses the average
  rating for each game. Estimate ratings (such as those in the spelling file)
  are not used. If one player in a game has a rating but the opponent
  does not, the opponent is presumed to have the same up to a limit of 2200.
  For example, if one player is rated 2500 and the opponent has no rating,
  the mean rating is (2500+2200)/2=2350.
  </p>

  <h3><name Rating>Player Rating Graph</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <green><run ::tools::graphs::rating::Refresh both>Rating
Graph</run></green> shows the ELO history of one, or many, players.
You can access the graph by pressing the "Rating Graph" button
in the <a PInfo>Player Information</a> window, or by selecting "Player Ratings"
from the Tools menu. Right-clicking the graph will refresh it.
  </p>

  <h3><name Score>Score Graph</name></h3>
  <p>
  The <green><run ::tools::graphs::score::Toggle>Score Graph</run></green> (Control-Shift-Z)
  shows the move evaluations (stored as comments in the current game) as a graph. </p>
  <p>
  The first step in using the Score Graph is to add scores to a game with Scid's <a Analysis Annotating>annotation feature</a>
  These scores have the format:
  <ul>
  <li><b>1.e4 {"+0.25 ...."}</b></li>
  </ul>
  Alternatively scores created by Crafty's annotate command are also recognised. These have the format:
  <ul>
  <li><b>1.e4 ({9:+0.25} ....)</b></li>
  </ul>
  Both formats are represented from White's perspective.
  In cases when the scores are not from whites perspective, one can select an option
  (in the Options Menu) for a correct perspective.
  </p>
  <h4>Features</h4>
  <p>
  Left Click positionally in the graph to go to the corresponding move.

set helpTitle(TB) "Tablebases"
set helpText(TB) {<h1>Tablebases</h1>

  <p>
  <i>A Tablebase is a file containing the </i><b>perfect result
  information</b><i> about all positions of a particular material setup,
  such as King and Rook versus King and Pawn. Tablebases for all
  positions up to five pieces (including the Kings) have been
  generated, and some simple six piece tablebases are also available.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid uses <b>Nalimov</b> tablebases, which are also used by many
  chess engines. The filenames often end with the suffix <b>.nbw.emd</b>
  or <b>.nbb.emd</b> (for <b>N</b>alimov <b>B</b>ases <b>W</b>hite/<b>B</b>lack).
  All 3, 4 and 5 piece Nalimov tablebases can be
  used in Scid.
  </p>
  <p>
  When a position found in a tablebase file is reached, the Game Information
  window (below the chessboard) will show the relevant information.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  Scid vs. PC can also lookup results from <url http://www.lokasoft.nl/tbweb.aspx>www.lokasoft.nl</url> ,
  but this information is not available in Game Information, only in the Tablebase Window, and can cause system lag.
  </i></p>

  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>
  To load the tablebases, select their directory(s) via
  the <b>Options--<gt>Tablebase Directory</b> menu item.
  Up to 4 directories may be selected.
  </p>
  <p>You can configure the amount of information shown via the 
  <b>Options--<gt>Game Information</b> menus.
  Selecting <b>Result and Best Moves</b> 
  gives the most information, but is often much slower than
  <b>Result Only</b>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Tablebase Window</h3>
  <p>
  You can get more comprehensive information 
  from the <green><run ::tb::Open>Tablebase Window</run></green>
  (Control - "="). This shows the result with perfect play
  of all legal moves from the current position.
  </p>
  <p>
  The window has two main parts. The Summary Frame (on the left) shows
  which tablebases Scid has found, and a summary for each
  tablebase. The Results Frame (on the right) shows optimal results for
  all moves from the current position displayed in the main window.
  </p>

  <h4>The Summary Frame</h4>
  <p>
  The top part of the summary frame lets you select a particular
  tablebase. Those available are shown in blue, those unavailable
  in gray, but you can select any tablebase.
  The lower part shows summary information for the
  selected tablebase. <i>Not all tablebases have a summary recorded in
  Scid yet.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
  The summary includes the frequency (how many games per million reach a
  position with this material, computed from a database of more than
  600,000 master-level games), a longest mate for either side, and the
  number of mutual (or "reciprocal") zugzwangs. A mutual zugwang is a
  position where white to move draws and black to move loses, or where
  white to move loses and black to move draws, or where whoever moves
  loses.
  </p>
  <p>
  For some tablebases with mutual zugzwangs, the summary also includes
  a list of all of the zugwang positions or a selection of them. A full
  list for every tablebase is not feasible since some tablebases have
  thousands of mutual zugzwangs.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can set up a random position from the selected tablebase by pressing
  the <b>Random</b> button.
  </p>

  <h4>The Results Frame</h4>
  <p>
  Results may be shown from local nalimov bases (if installed) , or generated from an online lookup to Lokasoft.org.
  The results frame is updated whenever the main chessboard changes.
  </p>
  <p>
  The first line of local bases shows how many moves win (+), draw (=), lose (-),
  or have an unknown result (?). The rest of the frame gives a more detailed
  list of results, ranking them from shortest to longest mates, then draws,
  then longest to shortest losses. All distances are to checkmate.
  </p>

  <h4>The Results Board</h4>
  <p>
  In a tablebase position, it is often useful what the tablebase results
  would be if all the pieces in the current position were on their
  current squares but one particular piece was moved somewhere else.
  For example, you may want to determine how close a king has to be to
  a passed pawn to win or draw a particular position. In endgame books
  this information is often called the <i>winning zone</i> or
  <i>drawing zone</i> of a piece in a position.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can find this information in Scid by pressing the button with an
  image of a chessboard, to show the <term>results board</term> in the
  tablebase window.
  When you press the left mouse button on any piece in this board, a
  symbol is drawn in each empty square showing what the tablebase result
  would be (with the same side to move as the current main window position)
  if the selected piece was on that square.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are five different symbols a square can have:
  a white <b>#</b> means White wins;
  a black <b>#</b> means Black wins;
  a blue <b>=</b> means the position is drawn;
  a red <b>X</b> means the position is illegal (because the kings are
  adjacent or the side to move is giving check); and
  a red <b>?</b> means the result is unknown because the necessary
  tablebase file is not available.
  </p>

  <h3>Obtaining Tablebase Files</h3>
  <p>
  The tablebases are available from 
<url ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt/TB/3-4-5/>Bob Hyatt's Ftp</url>
and
<url http://folk.uib.no/pfvaf/chesslib/Nalimov.htm>Chesslib</url>.

set helpTitle(Bookmarks) "Bookmarks"
set helpText(Bookmarks) {<h1>Bookmarks</h1>
  <p>
  Scid allows you to bookmark important games for easy
  future reference. The bookmarks menu is found in
  <green>File-<gt>Bookmarks</green>, or from the toolbar bookmark icon.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you open a bookmark Scid will automatically
  load the appropriate database, game and position.
  But if the database has been sorted or compacted, the bookmark
  details may be out of date. In this case Scid will search 
  for the best matching game (comparing player names, site, etc),
  but it is possible that a different game will match the criteria,
  and be incorrectly loaded.</p>
  <p><i>
  It is a good idea to re-bookmark a game if you edit its Players, Site, Result, Round or Year.
  </i></p>
  <p><i>
  Games in a PGN file or the Clipbase cannot be bookmarked.
  </i></p>

  <h3>Editing and Arranging Bookmarks</h3>
  <p>
  With the bookmark editor you can change the label for
  each bookmark, and add folders for better organization.
  Double clicking entries will load the game, and the 'Delete' , 'Up' and 'Down' keys
  can be used to delete a bookmark, or reorder it in the list.
  </p>

  <h3>Hints</h3>
  <p>
  You can use bookmarks for fast access to common databases
  by bookmarking a game from each database. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The bookmark editor contains a checkbox for controlling the display of
  folders. They can be shown as submenus (useful when there are
  many games), or as a single list.

set helpTitle(Cmdline) "Command-line options"
set helpText(Cmdline) {<h1>Command-line Options</h1>
  <p>
  When you start Scid from a shell or console, there are command-line
  options you can specify. Scid-format databases (with or without a
  file suffix such as ".si4") and PGN files to be opened can be given
  (for example)
  <ul>
  <li><b>scid mybase newgames.pgn</b></li>
  </ul>
  will immediately open the Scid Database "mybase" and the
  PGN file "newgames.pgn".
  </p>
  <p>
  There are also optional arguments to control which files Scid should
  search for and use when it starts. You can turn off the use of
  <a TB>tablebases</a> with the <b>-xtb</b> (or <b>-xt</b>) option,
  avoid loading the <a ECO>ECO openings classification</a> file with
  <b>-xeco</b> or <b>-xe</b>, and avoid loading the
  <a Maintenance Spellcheck>spelling</a> file
  with <b>-xspell</b> or <b>-xs</b>. Also, the option <b>-fast</b>
  or <b>-f</b> does all three, so <b>scid -f</b> is equivalent
  to <b>scid -xeco -xspell -xtb</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Additionally, a filter file (.sso) can be used on the command line.
  <ul>
  <li>scid mybase myfilter</li>
  </ul>
  will open mybase and run myfilter immediately against it to select a
  set of games. This can e.g. be used to select a list of unfinished
  games in a pgn file.

set helpTitle(Pgnscid) "Pgnscid"
set helpText(Pgnscid) {<h1>Pgnscid</h1>
  <p>
  Pgnscid is a command line utility (included with Scid) to convert PGN files to si4 databases.
  It's main advantage over Scid Imports is that it is <b>more reliable</b> for large PGN imports.
  </p>
  <p>
  To convert a file named "myfile.pgn", simply type:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>pgnscid myfile.pgn</b> </li>
  </ul>
  and a Scid database (consisting of "myfile.si4", "myfile.sg4"
  and "myfile.sn4") is created, with errors and warnings written to "myfile.err".
  </p>
  <p>
  To create the database in a different directory, or with a different name,
  one may add the database name to the command line. For eg:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>pgnscid myfile.pgn mybase</b> </li>
  </ul>
  creates a database consisting of the files "mybase.si4",
  "mybase.sg4" and "mybase.sn4".
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid and Pgnscid can also read <b>gzipped</b> PGN files directly.
  So large files compressed with gzip (such as "mybase.pgn.gz"),
  do not have to be gunzipped first.
  </p>

  <h3>Options</h3>
  <p>
  There are two options that may occur before the filename:
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>-f</b> forces overwriting of an existing database.
  (By default, pgnscid will not overwrite a database that already exist).
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>-x</b> causes pgnscid to ignore all comments/text <b>between games</b>.
  (By default, text between games is stored as a pre-game comment).
  </p>

  <h3>Player Name Formatting</h3>
  <p>
  Some commonsense formatting of Player Names is done automatically.
  These include: the number of spaces following a comma is standardized to one.
  Spaces at the start and end of names, and trailing dots, are removed.
  And Dutch prefixes such as "van den" and "Van Der" are normalized to have
  a capital "V" and small "d".
  </p>
  <p>
  Of course, one may manually <a Maintenance Editing>edit and spellcheck</a>
Player, Event, Site and Round Names via the Scid Maintenance Window once games
are imported.

}


set helpTitle(Formats) "File Formats"
set helpText(Formats) {<h1>Scid File Formats</h1>
  <p>
  Scid Databases consist of three files - an index file (file suffix .si4), a name file (.sn4) and a game file (.sg4).
</p>
<p><i>Scid only allocates three bytes for some data fields. This means si4's maximum number of games is 16,777,214.</i>
</p>

  <h3>The Index File (.si4)</h3>
  <p>
  The Index File contains a description for the database and a small fixed-size
  entry for each game. Each game entry includes essential information such as the result,
  date, player/event/site name IDs (the actual names are in the
  Name File), and some redundant but useful information 
  that is used to speed up searches (see <a Formats Fast>fast searches</a> for more information).
  </p>

  <h3>The Name File (.sn4)</h3>
  <p>
  Contains all Player, Event, Site and Round names used in the
  database. Each name is stored only once even if it occurs in many games, and there is
  a database restriction on the number of unique names. The limits are - 
</p>
<ul><ul>
    <li>Player names:	2^20 - 1</li>
    <li>Event  names:	2^19 - 1</li>
    <li>Site   names:	2^19 - 1</li>
    <li>Round  names:	2^18 - 1</li>
</ul></ul>
  and are defined in <b>namebase.h</b>
  The name file is usually the smallest of the three database files.
  </p>

  <h3>The Game File (.sg4)</h3>
  <p>
  This file contains the actual moves, variations and comments of each game.
  </p>
  <p><i>
  The move encoding format is very compact: most moves take only a single byte (8 bits)!
  This is done by storing the piece to move in 4 bits (2^4 = 16 pieces) and the
  move direction in another 4 bits. Only Queen diagonal moves cannot be stored in this small space.
  This compactness is the reason Scid does not support chess variants.
  </i></p>
  <p>
  When a game is *replaced* a new version is - in fact - created,
  so wasted space does accumulate over time. The database may
  be restored to its minimal size by <a Compact>compaction</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Other file formats</h3>
  <p>
  An <a EPD>EPD</a> file (<b>.epd</b>)
  contains a number of chess positions, each with a text comment.
  The EPD file format is described in the <a Related>PGN Standard</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  An email (<b>.sems</b>) file for a database stores details of the opponents
  you send email messages to.
  </p>
  <p>
  A SearchOptions (<b>.sso</b>) file contains Scid
  <a Searches Header>header</a> or
  <a Searches Material>material/pattern</a> search settings.
  </p>

  <h3><name Fast>Fast Searches in Scid</name></h3>
  <p>
  The Index File stores some redundant but useful
  information about each game to speed up position or material searches.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, the material of the final position is stored. If you search
  for rook and pawn endings, then all games that end with a queen, bishop
  or knight on the board (and have no pawn promotions) will be quickly
  skipped over.
  </p>
  <p>
  Another useful piece of information stored is the order in which pawns
  leave their home squares (by moving, or by being captured). This is used
  to speed up tree or exact position searches, especially for opening
  positions. For example, when searching for the starting position of the
  French Defence (1.e4 e6), every game starts with 1.e4 c5, or 1.d4, etc, will
  be skipped, but games starting with 1.e4 e5 will still need to be searched.

  <p>
  Scid's options are stored in Scid-User-Directory/<b>config/options.dat</b>.
  These are generally saved when Scid closes, but can also be saved by the <b>Save Options</b> menu
  </p>
  <p>
  The <green><run chooseBoardColors>Board and Chesspiece</run></green> options window allows to configure the look and feel.
  </p>
  <p>
  The options themselves are very numerous, and are generally dealt with in
  their own Help items, but below you'll find a few items explained.
  </p>

  <h3><name MyPlayerNames>My Player Names</name></h3>
  <p>
  <green><run editMyPlayerNames>My Player Names</run></green> allows one to
  take note of special player names.
  </p><p>
  Every time a game with a name in the list is loaded, the main chessboard
  will be flipped (if necessary) to show the game from that players perspective.
  </p>
  <p>
  The first "My Player Name" is also used by the Player vs. Computer feature.
  </p>
  <p>
  My Player Names are entered one per-line, and may contain the
  wildcards "<b>?</b>" (for exactly one character) and "<b>*</b>"
  (for a sequence of zero or more characters).
  </p>

  <h3><name Fonts>Fonts</name></h3>
  <p>
  Scid has four basic fonts; <b>Regular</b>, <b>Menu</b>, <b>Small</b> and <b>Fixed</b>.
  They are customized via the <green>Options-<gt>Fonts</green>, or by <b>Control+WheelMouse</b> in the PGN and Help windows.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>Fixed</b> font is used by the <a Tree>Tree</a> and <a Crosstable>Crosstable</a> windows, and requires a fixed-width font to make text allign nicely.
  </p>
  <p>
  The new <b>PGN Figurines</b> feature require the truetype font ScidChessBerin.ttf to be installed on your operating system. Scid vs. PC attempts to do this, but issues may arise in which case this feature will be disabled in the PGN Options Menu.

set helpTitle(ECO) "ECO Guide"
set helpText(ECO) {<h1>ECO Codes</h1>
  <p>
  An <b>Encyclopedia of Chess Openings</b> classification
  is a code used to identify chess openings.
  It consists of a letter from A to E, followed by two
  digits. For example,
  <b>C33</b> represents the <b>King's Gambit Accepted</b>.
  There are five hundred distinct ECO codes.
  </p>

  <h3>Scid Extensions to ECO</h3>
  <p>
  However, the ECO system is very limited and insufficient for modern games.
  Some codes are never used, while others are very frequent.
  To improve this, Scid allows an optional
  extension to the basic ECO codes. Codes may be extended with a
  letter from a to z, with a further extension - a digit from 1 to 4 - being
  possible but not yet used.
  So an extended code may look like <b>A41e</b> or <b>E99b2</b>.
  Many of the codes common in modern master-level games have
  extensions defined in the Scid ECO file.
  </p>

  <h3><name Browser>The ECO Browser Window</name></h3>
  <p>
  Scid's
  <run ::windows::eco::Refresh><green>ECO Browser Window</green></run> shows positions associated
  with each ECO code, and their frequency and performance 
  (<b>in ECO classified games</b>) in the current database. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The upper pane shows a bar graph with three sections: the lowest
  (light blue) represents White wins, the middle represents draws, and the top (dark blue), the number of Black wins.
  The graph illustrates at a glance an openings characteristics - whether
  draws are common or White or Black is winning.
  To go to a deeper ECO level click on a bar in the graph, or to go higher
  right-click, press the <button bookmark_up> button, or left-arrow.
  </p>
  <p>
  You can also navigate with keys, writing the ECO code you are interesting in. For instance, if you want to see the ECO code B75
  (for the Yugoslav Attack in the Sicilian Dragon), you just press the key combination 'b75' (or 'B75'). 
  If you want to go up to a more general code, like B7, you can just press Left-Arrow. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The bottom pane shows the positions for a particular ECO code according to the ECO file loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>ECO classify games</b> button will permanently add ECO classifications to selected games in the current database.
  </p>

  <h3>Loading an ECO File</h3>
  <p>
  Scid will attempt to load the default <b>scid.eco</b> at start up.
  If it cannot, or you wish to use another file, one may be loaded manually via the
  <run ::windows::eco::LoadFile><green>Load ECO File</green></run> feature,
  after which this will be loaded automatically.
  </p>

# Book window help
set helpTitle(Book) "Book Window"
set helpText(Book) {<h1>Book Window</h1>
  <p>
  Opening Books are small databases recording moves at the start of a game
  and how often each move occurs. Scid's <run
  ::book::Open><green>Book Window</green></run> allows perusal of opening
  books, and a few nifty features besides.
  </p><p>
  <i>Scid uses the popular <b>Polyglot</b> book format, and comes with a few
  databases  already installed, including gm2600.bin and Elo2400.bin</i>.  </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
  <p>
  In Scid vs. PC, two books can be viewed at once. Normally, moves are listed in order
  of frequency, but selecting the <b>Alphabetical</b> box will sort them; placing
  like moves side-by-side.
  </p>
<p>Scid also has an Opponent's Book. [todo ???] and <a BookTuning>Book Tuning</a> feature.</p>

<h2><name Polyglot>Polyglot</name></h2>

<p>
<i>Scid comes with an altered version of Polyglot. The below features require the
<url http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/details1/PolyGlot.html>full version</url></i> of the command line tool. 
</p>
<h4>Making Opening Books</h4>
<p>
First, remove games with non-standard starts.
These can be found by <a Searches Header>searching</a> for games with the "non-standard start" flag.
Then, negate the filter, <a Export>export</a> the games to PGN, and from the command line:
<br>
<b>polyglot make-book -pgn GAMES.PGN -bin BOOK.BIN -max-ply 30</b>
<br>

# Tactical game window help
set helpTitle(ComputerGame) "Playing the Computer"
set helpText(ComputerGame) {<h1>Playing the Computer</h1>

<p> Scid offers two ways to play a Computer Opponent. They are against <a ComputerGame PhalanxGame>Phalanx</a>,
or any installed <a ComputerGame UCIGame>UCI Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Other computer opponents can be found in the
training features of <a Analysis>Engine Analysis</a>, <a TB>Tablebases</a> and <a Tree>Tree</a></i>.
</p>

<h2><name PhalanxGame>Playing Phalanx</name></h2>
<p>
<run ::tacgame::config><green>Phalanx</green></run> is an old xboard engine written by Dusan Dobes.
With it one may play a game of Normal, Fischer (castling not supported), or Random Pawns Chess.
</p><p>
It is not a strong chess engine by modern standards, and - even more - it is programmed to make "human" like errors.
It's level can be adjusted roughly between 1200 (a bright teenager with some experience), to 2200 (a National
Master).  There is also a computer coach (Toga II) watching, which will indicate when Phalanx has made a blunder.
</p>
<p><b>Coach's analysis time</b> <i>is the allowable time for the
coach to check the players moves for errors. If this time is not
limited the coach is allowed to think in the background.</i></p>
</ul>

<h2><name UCIGame>Playing an UCI Engine</name></h2>

  <p>
  Stronger opponents can be found against any installed
  <run ::sergame::config><green>UCI Engine</green></run>.
  By default, this only includes Toga - but users may wish to <a Analysis List>install others</a>.
  Stockfish is a good alternative, as it has an adjustable "Skill Level" feature.
  </p>
  <p>
  Engine parameters may be configured - to tune performance or utilize engine features.
  <b>Opening Books</b> and <b>Specific Openings</b> to follow can also be selected.
  </p>
  <p>
  Other configuration items are straight forward except:
  </p>
  <ul>
     <li><b>Fixed depth</b> does not set the time per game but
     the depth the engine will calculate in half moves. As this
     disables the ability to calculate deeper if necessary, the
     computer will not see certain mates and combinations, the engine
     may play weaker and thus offer a better partner for training
     purposes.
     </li>

     <li><b>Nodes</b> is similar to limiting the search depth,
     but here the engine has to move after the evaluation of a certain
     number of positions. (The default is 10,000.)
     </li>

  <li><b>Permanent thinking</b> (sometimes also called ponder)
  allows the engine to calculate on the players time. If unchecked, the
  engine will stop analysing the position if the player has the move.
  If the game is set for a fixed time per move, this will weaken the
  engine. On the other hand, the engine might move immediately, if the
  player made the move it was analysing on the players time.</li>
  <li><b>Coach is Watching</b> will open a dialogue offering to take
  back a move if the player made a blunder (due to the engines
  evaluation of his last move).</li>
  </ul>

set helpTitle(Correspondence) "Correspondence Chess"
set helpText(Correspondence) {<h1>Correspondence Chess</h1>

<p>
Scid offers currently two main functionalities for correspondence
chess.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>eMail Chess</b> proceeds by sending the current game via eMail
   to your opponet once you made your move. To this end an eMail message
   is created in your prefered email program with the current game
   attached to it in PGN format. Of course all comments and
   variations are stripped off before.
   </li>
   <li><b>Correspondence Chess Servers</b> are supported by means of the
   Xfcc protocol. Here external tools are used to fetch the games from
   your account(s) and deliver them to Scid for synchronisation. After
   you made your move this move is sent to your opponent also by means of
   Xfcc. The fetch and send tool are implemented as external tools for
   easy extension if other protocols arise.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
If any of the correspondence chess functions are accessed from the
menu a new window opens up. It can be opened manually from the window
menu or one can use the keyboard shortcut F12. There are two
additional shortcuts:
<ul>
   <li><b>Ctrl-F12</b>
      This will open the correspondence chess window and the default
      database. It will also process your current Inbox.
   </li>
   <li><b>Alt-F12</b>
      This will open the correspondence chess window, the default
      database and also initiate the fetch of Xfcc games in one go.
   </li
</ul>
Please see below for further details.

This window contains the neccessary buttons to navigate through
ongoing games, shortcut keys to fetch games by means of the Xfcc
protocol and sync in eMail based games as well as a console stating
which messages where sent or retrieved. Additionally this window
conatins a list of ongoing games retrieved from your Inbox directory.
</p>

<p>
To use the correspondence chess features a database of the type
"Correspondence chess" has to be opened before calling any
correspondence chess functions. If you do not have such a database
yet, just create a new database an set its type to "Correspondence
chess" by means of the <a Maintenance>Maintenance</a> function.
Setting the type is important as Scid will recognise the database for
synchronisation by this type. As this database is empty after the
creation Scid will treat all correspondence chess games it receives at
first synchronisation as new games and append them to this database.
</p>

<p>
If no database of the type "Correspondence chess" is currently opened
Scid will remid you of doing so. However, do not open more than one
database of this type as Scid then can not recognise the one to use.
</p>

<h3>Basic functionality</h3>

<p>
If everything is set up correctly the usage of the correspondence
chess functions can easily accessed by the follwoing buttons:
<ul>
   <li><button tb_CC_Retrieve> Retrieve the correspondence chess games.
   To this end the external fetch tool is called and all games retrieved
   via that way as well as all other games that are stored in Scids Inbox
   (see below) are synchronised into the current correspondence chess
   database.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_Prev> Goes to the previous game in Scids Inbox
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_Next> Goes to the next game in Scids Inbox
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_Send> Sends your move to the opponent by either
   creating a new eMail message in your prefered mail program or by
   sending the move to a chess server in case of Xfcc.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_delete> empties your In- and Outbox directories.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_online> is shown if the game list was refreshed
   from the server within the current Scid session. The tool tip for
   this icon shows date and time of the last refresh.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_offline> indicates, that Xfcc status icons are
   restored from saved results. No update has taken place in the
   current Scid session. The tool tip for this icon shows date and
   time of the last refresh.
   </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
See also the list of <a CCIcons>Icons and Status Indicators</a>.
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
Correspondence Chess within Scid is based upon a normal Scid
database that holds the games and some helpers external to Scid that
handle the "non-chess-parts". These tools and parameters must be set
up once, and are stored afterwards for future use.
</p>

<p>
To access the configuration dialog choose <menu>Play</menu>
<menu>Correspondence Chess</menu><menu>Configure</menu> from the
menu. The details are described in <a CCSetupDialog>Correspondence
Chess Setup</a>. Quitting this dialog by the <b>[Ok]</b> button will
automatically store your options.
</p>

<h3>Retrieving the games</h3>
<p>
Depending wether you play correspondence chess via eMail or via a
chess server the actual retrieval process differs slightly. Generally
it results in a set of games in PGN format located in Scids Inbox
directory. This offers also the possibility of automatic retrieval via
external software.
</p>
<p>
Once the games are in Scids Inbox invoking <menu>Process Inbox</menu>
from the menu will work though the Inbox and add new moves to the
games already in the database. Additionally it will add games not
found in the current correspondence chess database as new games.
</p>

<p><a CCeMailChess>Correspondence Chess via eMail</a> describes the
details for the usage of eMail, while in <a CCXfcc>Correspondence
Chess via Chess Servers</a> describes the same for correspondence
chess servers.
</p>

<h3>Stepping through games</h3>
<p>
After games are retrieved they are loaded to Scids clipboard database
and new moves are added and stored in the correspondence chess
database opened. The most convenient way to step through the games is
by the two buttons <button tb_CC_Prev> and <button tb_CC_Next> which
go to the previous and the next game, respectively. The difference to
the functions from the <menu>Games</menu> menu is, that these two
buttons scroll only between the games in Scids Inbox which are
supposed to be your actually ongoing games. Of course the
Correspondence Chess database might contain much more games, but
normally you do not want to go through all these to find out what your
opponent moved in a current game.
</p>
<p>
Note that a header search is required incorporating some fields that
are not indexed by Scid. Hence, storing your correspondence chess
games in a huge reference database might not be advisable as the
search times may be quite long. If you play a lot and your own
database gets quite large, search times can be reduced by moving
finished games to an archive database, or by just createing a new
database for the ongoing games. Scid will treat all games not existing
in the correspondence chess database already as new games and add them
automatically. Hence, it is sufficient to open an empty database of
type "Correspondence chess" and call <menu>Process Inbox</menu> to
import all currently ongoing games.
</p>
<p>
Equivalent to the two buttons mentinoned are the items <menu>Previous
Game</menu> and <menu>Next Game</menu> from the <menu>Correpondence
Chess</menu> menu.
</p>
<p>
An alternate way to jump to a specific game is by double clicking on
it within the game list.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you set up your player names correctly (by means of
<menu>My Player Names</menu>) Scid will rotate the board for you to
play always upwards. You can have multiple player names. See also <a
Options MyPlayerNames>My Player Names</a> for details.
</p>

<h3>Analyse and make a move</h3>
<p>
All analysis features can be used for correspondence chess games.
Variations, annotations etc. can be added just like in normal game
analysis. Once finished, Scid will take the last half move added to
the game and treat it as the current move to send. No checking wether
only one half a move was added or which side to move is done here,
hence, only one half move to the mainline must be added!  In case a
chess server is used Scid also sends the last comment added to the
server which might be usefull for communication with the opponent. In
eMail chess this can be done by the normal mail message, so there all
commments are stripped off.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the Send button <button tb_CC_Send> will have Scid to
determine the type of the correspondence chess game displayed (eMail or
a server game) and call either your eMail program or the external send
tool to submit your move. Calling <menu>Send move</menu> is equivalent
to this button. Alternatively, <menu>Mail move</menu> can be used to
send the current game via eMail. In case of an eMail game this
function is equivalent to <menu>Send move</menu>. In case of a server
based game an eMail message is generated. Note however, that it will
not necessarily contain a proper recipient as eMail addresses are not
exchanged in server based correspondence chess.

<h1>Icons and Status Indicators</h1>
<p>
To shorten the display, a set of icons is used in the game list. Some
of them are only present in certain circumstances, some are only valid
for Xfcc based games, some for eMail based games. These indicators are
stored internally and are restored to the last update from the server
if no interet connection is available.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><button tb_CC_online> is shown if the game list was refreshed
   from the server within the current Scid session. The tool tip for
   this icon shows date and time of the last refresh.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_offline> indicates, that Xfcc status icons are
   restored from saved results. No update has taken place in the
   current Scid session. The tool tip for this icon shows date and
   time of the last refresh.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_envelope> This is an eMail based game. In those
   games many of the status flags used in Xfcc-based games are not
   available due to the limitation of the medium.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_yourmove>
   Its your move. Note: this status is only updated if you
   synchronise your games with the server, that is, it always refers
   to the servers status at last syncronisation.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_oppmove>
   Its the opponents move. Note: this status is only updated if you
   synchronise your games with the server, that is, it always refers
   to the servers status at last syncronisation.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_draw>
   Peace was agreed by a draw.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_book>

   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_database>
   The use of databases is allowed for this game.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_tablebase>
   The use of endgame tablebases (e.g. Nalimov tablebases etc.) is
   allowed for this game.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_engine>
   Chess Engines are allowed for this game. Sometimes these games are
   also refered to as "Advanced Chess".
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_outoftime>

   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_message>
   Your oppenent sent a message along with his last move. Check the
   game notation.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
In Xfcc games, each opponents country may be displayed by the
associated flag, if the server provides that information. For eMail
based games this can be achieved by adding additional PGN tags for
<i>whiteCountry</i> and <i>blackCountry</i>, each followed by the
international three letter country code according to ISO 3166-1
(e.g. "EUR" <button flag_eur>, "USA" <button flag_usa>, "GBR"
<button flag_gbr>, "FRA" <button flag_fra>, "RUS" <button flag_rus>, "CHN"
<button flag_chn>...).

set helpTitle(CCXfcc) "Correspondence Chess Servers"
set helpText(CCXfcc) {<h1>Correspondence Chess Servers</h1>

<p>
There exist several correspondence chess servers throughout the
internet. Generally, they are used by means of a web browser, so no
specific software is required. However many of them also offer an
interface to specialised chess software via a protocoll called Xfcc.
The integration of Xfcc is done in Scid via external helper tools set
in the <a CCSetupDialog>Configuration</a> dialog for correspondence
chess.
</p>

<h3>Start a new game</h3>
<p>
Xfcc does not allow to start a new game itself. Searching for an
opponent and starting a game is instead handled by the chess server
on their web site. Once the game is started however, Scid can be used to
retrieve the moves of the opponent, add them to the internal database,
analyse them and so on. All features of Scid are to the users disposal
though certain modes of play may not allow them (e.g.  normal games
usually do not permit the usage of chess engines for analysis).
</p>

<h3>Retrieve games</h3>
<p>
Open a database that holds correspondence chess games. This database
has to be of type "Correspondence chess". 
</p>

Notes: 
<ul>
   <li>If Scid does not find a correspondence chess database it will
   inform you to open one.
   </li>
   <li>If the database does not hold the games that are fetchted from
   the server they are treated as new games and added to the database
   automatically.
   </li>
   <li>Scid will use the first database of type "Correspondence Chess"
   that is currently open. For this reason only one such DB should be
   opened at a time.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
Xfcc always retrieves all games hosted on a specified server for your
user ID at once. To retrieve the games just press the
<button tb_CC_Retrieve> icon or select <menu>Retrieve Games</menu> from the
<menu>Correspondence Chess</menu> menu. As a server connection is
required to fetch new games be sure that the system has network
access. Scid will call the fetch tool configured in the <a
CCSetupDialog>Configuration</a> dialog which will place the games in
PGN format in Scids inbox. It may take some time to retrieve the
answer, so be patient. After the games are retrieved the
correspondence chess database is updated accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b>By using the <button tb_CC_delete> you can empty your whole
In- and Outbox directories.
</p>

<p>
Once the games are retrieved their counterpart is searched within the
correspondence chess db and new moves are added accordingly. As Xfcc
servers may offer various ways to insert moves (via web or mobile or
other programs...) it might well be that Scid will have to add half of
the game to the db. This poses no problem. Scid will add all moves
returned in the game from the server. Scid will however not replace
the game from the beginning as then all your analysis may be lost.
Hence it is <b>important to note</b> that you must not insert moves to
the main line beyond your own last move! To add continuations please
use variations!
</p>
<p>
Xfcc base games offer extensive status display within the games list.
This information, however, is only available if Scids internal Xfcc
support is used.  The follwoing icon are for visual display:
<ul>
   <li><button tb_CC_draw> A draw was agreed with the last move.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_yourmove> You're on the move.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_oppmove> Your opponent is on the move.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_book> This game allows the use of opening books.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_database> This game allows the use of databases.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_tablebase> This game allows the use of tablebases.
   </li>
   <li><button tb_CC_engine> This game allows the use of chess engines.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
Additonally Scid will display the clock for both parties <b>at the
time of sync</b> as well as the chess variant played. Note however
that Scid currently only supports standard chess.
</p>
<p>
Note: only if the proper icon (book, database, tablebase, engine)
is dispalyed, the useage of these tools is allowed. It is forbidden
otherwise. Be fair and respect these rules.
</p>
<p>
Note: if other sources have placed games in your inbox (e.g. from
your eMail correspondence chess) they are also synchronised in the
retrieval step into the database as the whole Inbox is worked through.
This allows for adding eMail games to the Inbox, then switch to Scid,
hit <button tb_CC_Retrieve> and all games are up to date.  Games that are not
yet found in the database are treated as new games and appended to the
database.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>By using the <button tb_CC_delete> you can empty your whole
In- and Outbox directories.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note for programmers</b>: the fetch tool is called with the Inbox path as
parameter. It is thought to work through all server accounts and place
properly formatted PGN files in the path passed to it. These files
should contain additional header fields as they are known by the cmail
tool. (See <a CCeMailChess>Correspondence Chess via eMail</a> for
information about the fields required.)

set helpTitle(CCeMailChess) "Correspondence Chess via eMail"
set helpText(CCeMailChess) {<h1>Correspondence Chess via eMail</h1>

<p>
eMail offers a very convenient way ot play correspondence chess. The
standard application in the Un*x world for this till today is xboard
together with its cmail helper. As it allows for almost automatic
handling of correspondence chess eMails and additonally does not add
anything not conforming to PGN it is also the model for Scid to handle
eMail chess. By just preserving the whole PGN header such games can be
played with any opponent who has a tool to handle PGN.
</p>

<h3>eMail Chess</h3>
<p>
Scid can handle eMail correspondence chess games almost automatically.
The way how this is done is kept compatible to the cmail utility that
comes with xboard on Un*x systems. (Having said this implies that you
can play against an opponent using cmail/xboard.) It works by sending
the games as whole PGN files too and fro as mail attachements, while
the header contains certain tags that allows them to be recognised and
sorted together. For this reason the user has to be careful with
editing of the header fields.  Note that fields with explicit values have
to be set to exactly this value for eMail chess. Starting a game with
Scid will do this automatically, but you <b>must not</b> overwrite
or delete them!
</p>
<p>
Essential header fields are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><term>Event</term>: by default "Email correspondence game"
   </li>
   <li><term>Site</term>: has to be "NET"
   </li>
   <li><term>Mode</term>: has to be "EM"
   </li>
   <li><term>WhiteNA</term>: contains the eMail address of the white player. Note
   that only the bare address is stored there in the form
   <term>user@host.org</term>.
   </li>
   <li><term>BlackNA</term>: contains the eMail address of the black player
   similar to WhiteNA.
   </li>
   <li><term>CmailGameName</term>: Contains a <b>unique</b> identifier for
   the game. This is used to sort the games together.
   <p>
   While Scid could use some database index this is not possible for
   non-DB-based tools like cmail. For this reason the
   <term>CmailGameName</term> parameter is user suppied. It must be
   unique! The easiest way is something of the form
   <term>xx-yy-yyyymmdd</term> where xx is a shortcut for the white
   player, yy one for the black player, and yyyymmdd the current date.
   </p>
   <p>For Xfcc-based games this field has also to be set to a unique
   identifier but there the server name and the unique game number on
   this server can be used, that is this identifier is of the form
   <term>MyXfccServer-12345</term>.
   </p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
eMail based chess does not contain that extended status codes as Xfcc.
These games show the <button tb_CC_envelope> icon to notify them as
eMail based.
</p>

<h3>Start a new game</h3>
<p>
This opens a dialog for the input of the own and the opponents name as
they should appear in the header as well as the eMail addresses of
both parties. Additionally a <b>unique</b> game ID has to be inserted.
The easiest way for this ID is something of the form
<term>xx-yy-yyyymmdd</term> where xx is a shortcut for the white
player, yy one for the black player, and yyyymmdd the current date.
This id is a text and it is important to identify the games uniquely.
Users of cmail will also know this ID as <i>game name</i>. It must
only contain letters and numbers, the minus sign and the underscore.
Please avoid other characters.
</p>
<p>
After the dialog is quit by pressing the <b>[Ok]</b> button a new
game is appended to the currently loaded correspondence chess database
and the PGN header is set properly. Just make your move and send it as
mentioned below.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve games</h3>

<p>
Scid does not handle your mailbox automatically. This would,
considering the wide range of possible mail setups these days, involve
a huge amount of code. For this reason Scid relies on your normal
eMail program which is far more suitable for this purpose than Scid
can ever be. To get a game into Scid just save the attached PGN file
to Scid's inbox and process the inbox by either <menu>Retrieve
Games</menu> or the <button tb_CC_Retrieve> button or
<menu>Process Inbox</menu>. The difference between the two is that
the first one will also fetch and populate the Inbox additionally with
games from another source (say Xfcc) by either the internal Xfcc
support or an external fetch tool called. Hence
<button tb_CC_Retrieve> is the most convenient way if you use both types of
correspondence chess games.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b> The <menu>Retrieve Games</menu> menu or the
<button tb_CC_Retrieve> button do <b>not</b> fetch your eMail messages! You
have to save your PGN files to Scids Inbox by hand. Probably this can
be automatised by your eMail program (on Un*x systems setting up a
mime handler is easy enough by means of <term>.mailcap</term>).
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>By using the <button tb_CC_delete> you can empty your whole
In- and Outbox directories.
</p>

<h3>Send the response</h3>

<p>
After making your move send it by either the <menu>Mail Move</menu>
item from the menu via <menu>Send move</menu> which is equivalent to
<button tb_CC_Send>. The latter will Scid have to recognise the game
as eMail correspondence and send it by mail while the former method
will force Scid to generate an eMail message.
</p>
<p>
Of course Scid strips the the game bare of any comments and variations
before attaching it to the outgoing eMail as you probably do not want to send
your analysis along.
</p>
<p>
If a GUI-mailer is used, its usual compose window is opened. The
address of your opponent is filled in as well as a generic subject
containing the game id for easy filtering and the bcc address if
specified in the <a CCSetupDialog>Configuraion</a> dialog. The mail
body is set to contain the FEN of the final position and the list of
moves made so far. This way the opponent can quickly look up your
move. Finally, Scid attaches the current game including your move in
PGN format to the mail message.
</p>
<p>
When using a mailx compatible tool no window is opened and the mail is
sent invisibly by invoking the tool specified in the background. In
this case the generated mail contains the PGN also in the mail body.
</p>
<p>
Note that as eMail chess works by sending the whole PGN file you must
not add more than your half move. Scid does not check here wether
more than one half move was added to the mainline, simply as Scid does
not know which move it was, when you sent yours.
</p>

}

set helpTitle(CCSetupDialog) "Correspondence Chess Setup"
set helpText(CCSetupDialog) {<h1>Correspondence Chess Setup</h1>

<p>
The entries in the configuration dialog are preset to some default
parameters but those must not match the reality on your system, so
adoption will surely be necessary. All parameters are stored in the
configuration file automatically once the dialog is closed via the
<b>[Ok]</b> button. The parameters are effective immediately.
</p>

<p><b>Note</b> that Scid will use the defaults until this setup dialog
is called and quit by selecting the <term>OK</term> button. The
default values are never stored in Scids internal config file until
then. Additionally, if Scid can not find a valid config, it will try
to set up the correspondence chess functions automatically. By default
it will store all data in the <term>data</term> subdir of Scids
configuration. Here also a valid DB as well as the necessary
In/Outboxes are created.
</p>

<p>
<b>Default Database</b>:
This defines the default database for
correspondence chess games. It can be accessed easily via
<menu>Open Database</menu> in the <menu>Correspondence Chess</menu>
menu. The advantage of this method is, that this database does not
show up in the <i>recent databases</i> lists and that you can have a
specific file for this. This database <b>has to be</b> of type
"Correspondence chess". Opening a database of this type by any other
means is also ok, so probably you may want to ignore this setting
(e.g. if you call Scid with your correspondence chess database on
startup.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Inbox (path)</b>:
In this directory Scid will look for correspondence chess games stored
in PGN format. These games are used for the synchronisation of the
correspondence chess database. Generally, Scid does not care how the
games come to this directory. It will just work through all PGN files
located there. This offers the possibility to use some external tools
to fetch games to this location. Additionally, in eMail chess one
should just save the PGN files received from the opponent in this
directory.
</p>
<p>
Scid will not read a mailbox of whatever sort, it just handles
all PGN files placed in that directory. Also note, that it will
synchronise games with the current database. However, if a game
from this directory does not yet exist in the database it is
treated as new game and appended to the database.
</p>
<p>
For the synchronisation process to work the PGN files must contain
some additional header information that are in perfect agreement with
the PGN Standard. Please have a look at <a CCeMailChess>Correspondence
Chess via eMail</a> if you want to create your own tool or if you are
migrating data from some other system.
</p>

<p>
<b>Outbox (path)</b>:
The inverse of the <i>Inbox</i>. Scid places here PGN files of the
outgoing games. For eMail chess this is essential as the PGN files have
to be attached to an eMail message.  For Xfcc, where only the move is
sent, this would not be necessary, however the Outbox directory offers
a convenient way to link up to your PDA or for any other usage as the
PGN files contained in the Outbox will also contain your last move.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use internal Xfcc support</b>:
If checked Scid will not use the external tools specified as external
protocol handlers but use its internal Xfcc support to fetch games and
send moves. This will be the most convenient way to access an Xfcc
server and should be used as default.
</p>
<p>
This feature requires http and tDOM support for TCL to be installed.
Usually, these modules are distributed with your TCL installation,
however, on some systems they have to be installed explicitly. If
either one is not found this function is disabled.
</p>
<p>
<b>Xfcc Configuration</b>:
Give the path and filename of the config file for the xfcc protocol
handler. This path is also passed on to the external protocol handlers
to be used by them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fetch Tool</b>:
This program is called to retrieve correspondence chess
games from a correspondence chess server. This helper just has to
fetch the games from whatever source it likes, generate a proper PGN
file containing the necessary PGN header. Tools for fetching games
from Xfcc-servers exist as external programs and these are the natural
tools to set up here. For future protocols one could easily generate
an external fetch tool that handles this protocol. Also automatisation
is possible if this functionality is done externally.
</p>
<p>
Note: This tool is <b>not</b> called for retrieval of eMail chess
messages!
</p>

<p>
<b>Send Tool</b>: 
This is the inverse of the fetch tool, primarily also ment for Xfcc
support or any future protocol that might come up. The send tool,
however, is called from Scid with several parameters where the call
looks like:
<term>
SendTool Outbox Name GameID MoveCount Move "Comment" resign claimDraw offerDraw acceptDraw
</term>
</p>

<p>
The meaning of the parameters is as follows:
   <ul>
      <li><term>Outbox</term>: The Outbox path set in this dialog. The
      send tool is meant to generate a correctly formatted PGN file
      there.
      </li>
      <li><term>Name</term>: The name of the player to move as stated
      in the PGN header. For Xfcc this would be the login name. It is
      identical to the player name in the PGN header.
      </li>
      <li><term>MoveCount</term>: The move number to send.
      </li>
      <li><term>Move</term>: The actual move in SAN.
      </li>
      <li><term>"Comment"</term>: A comment sent to the opponent. Scid
      inserts the last comment of the game. That is these comments are
      treated as comments to the opponent. Note that the comment is
      quoted, so multiline comments should be possible.
      </li>
      <li><term>resign</term>: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user
      wants to resign. Set to 1 if the user invokes
      <menu>Resign</menu> from the <menu>Correspondence Chess</menu>
      menu.
      </li>
      <li><term>claimDraw</term>: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user
      wants to claim a draw. Set to 1 if the user invokes
      <menu>Claim Draw</menu> from the <menu>Correspondence Chess</menu>
      menu.
      </li>
      <li><term>offerDraw</term>: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user
      wants to offer a draw. Set to 1 if the user invokes <menu>Offer
      Draw</menu> from the <menu>Correspondence Chess</menu> menu.
      </li>
      <li><term>acceptDraw</term>: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user
      wants to accept a draw offered by the opponent. Set to 1 if the
      user invokes <menu>Accept Draw</menu> from the
      <menu>Correspondence Chess</menu>
      menu.
      </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
Note: This tool is <b>not</b> called for eMail chess!
</p>

<p>
<b>Mail program</b>:
This gives the path to your prefered eMail program. This program is
called for eMail chess to compose the message to the opponent.
</p>

<p>
<b>(B)CC Address</b>:
A copy of the outgoing message is sent to this address as blind copy.
Note however, that if a GUI mailer is used it has normally its own
outgoing mail handling. Hence, setting this address might duplicate
messages. It can be used to transfer a game to another address though.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mode</b>:
Unfortunately there exists a wide range of mail clients and they use
very different calling conventions. Some common conventions, and
examples of programs that use them, are listed here. The mailprogram
will be called with the convention selected. In case it is not known
which convention is used one of those offered might match and do the
trick. Note however that quite a number of mail programs are not
capable of sending attachements when called from another program. In
this case you will have to either change your mail client or add the
attachement placed in Scids Outbox by hand.
</p>
<p>Hint: mailx or one of its many clones should be available as a
command line application on almost any platform as an easy to set up
tool. In case none of the conventions work with your preferred
client or this client can not handle mails with attachements by calls
from the command line, installing mailx would be an option.
</p>
<p>Hint: mutt uses the systems mail transport (aka
sendmail/exim/postfix). To hook up with those (arguably) not easy to
set up tools mutt is a perfect option. On a decent Un*x with a proper
setup it should be the most painless way to handle eMail chess.
(Though not many properly set up systems exist, especially in the
Linux world.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Attachement parameter</b>: 
This parameter is used to specify an attachement. It is <b>only</b>
used in <term>mailx</term> mode.
</p>
<p>
<b>Subject parameter</b>:
This parameter is used to specify the subject of the mail message. It
is <b>only</b> used in <term>mailx</term> mode.

# Tactics Trainer
# Renamed to Puzzles S.A
set helpTitle(TacticsTrainer) "Mate in ..N.. Puzzles"
set helpText(TacticsTrainer) {<h1>Mate in ..N.. Puzzles</h1>
  <p>
  Scid's
<run ::tactics::config><green>Mate in ...</green></run> widget
  is a handy way to improve your chess skills. And waste some time!
  The feature is fairly straight forward, though not especially polished.
</p>
  <h3>Configuration</h3>
  <p>
  The <term>Engine analysis time</term> slider limits Toga's
  time to solve the puzzle (which are generated on-the-fly).
  Five seconds should generally
  be enough as most puzzles contain forced continuations.
  It does not describe how long one has to solve any puzzle.
  </p>
<p>
  Scid stores data about solved puzzles within the database.
  Clicking the <term>Reset scores</term> button will reset this
  information marking all puzzles as unsolved. And unless care is taken, 
<b>reinstalling Scid will overwrite puzzles solved</b>!
  </p>

  <h3>Playing</h3>
  <p>
  If you get stuck, select <term>Show Solution</term> to add the solution as
  <run ::pgn::Open><green>PGN</green></run>
  (where it can be easily examined). Unclicking the button will reset the puzzle for another try.
  </p>
  <p>
  Clicking the <term>Next</term> button allows the user to skip any
  puzzle, and individual exercises can be opened via the
<run ::windows::gamelist::Open><green>Game List</green></run> widget.
  </p>
  <p>
  Some exercises do not end in a mate, with the
  solution only giving a clear advantage. If one wants to play out these
  scenarios and only count the exercise solved in case of a win, just
  check the <term>Win won game</term> option. This option has no
  meaning in case of a clear mate solution.
  </p>
  <p>
  The clock is only for the user to check how long he thought about the
  position at hand. No evaluation is done on the time required to solve a problem.
  </p>

  <h3>Other notes</h3>
  <p>
  This feature is implemented using special databases containing the puzzles
  , installed in Scid's default <term>Bases</term> directory.
  If for any reason this directory option has been changed , it can be specified in
  <run setTacticsBasesDir><green>Options--<gt>Bases Directory</green></run>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Unlike other bases, puzzle bases do not contain full games; only starting positions.
  Any puzzle book can be converted to a trainings base by setting up the
  positions and storing the new database into the <term>Bases</term> directory. 
  In the <a Maintenance>Maintenance</a> window, set the new base type to <term>Tactics</term>,
  and edit the <term>Description</term> to give the database a name.

set helpTitle(FindBestMove) "Find best move"
set helpText(FindBestMove) {<h1>Find Best Move</h1>
  <p>
  The Find Best Move training excercise uses <b>specially prepared databases</b>
  to train the player to find tactical shots (non-obvious and unique winning moves).
  </p>
  <p>
  Scid will initially jump to the first relevant position in the current database,
  allowing the player to study for the tactical shot. The PGN window will close, and Hide Next Move is enabled.
  </p>
  <p>
  Re-selecting the Play--<gt>Training--<gt>FindBestMove menu, or double clicking to the left of the board, 
  will search for the next position/game.
  </p>
  <h2>Preparing Databases</h2>
  <p>
  Databases are prepared by <a Analysis Annotating>annotating games</a> with a UCI engine and enabling
  "Mark tactical exercises". This marks relevant moves a special comment (beginning with <b>****D</b> and commented
  in the analysis.tcl source file),  and tags the game with the tactics <b>T</b> flag.</p>
  <p><i>For a move to be regarded as a Tactical Shot, it must be a unique winning move, that is not obvious - ie found at depth <lt>= 3.</i></p>
  </p>
  <p>
  Mainline Scid mentions the existence of an already prepared base of 1500 games, but
  the author can't find this base.

# FICS Find Opponent
set helpTitle(FICSfindopp) "Finding an Opponent"
set helpText(FICSfindopp) {<h1>Finding an Opponent</h1>
  <p>
  There are several ways to start playing. The easiest are the <b>Find Opponent</b>
  and <b>Offers Graph</b> widgets.
  </p>

  <h3>Find Opponent</h3>

  <p>
  Click on the <b>Find Opponent</b> button and you'll see a dialogue from
  which you can challenge other players for a game.
  Select how long you'd like to play for, and other options, then 
  press the <b>Make Offer</b> button.

Options:
  <br>
  <ul>

      <li><term>Time</term> Base time for game in minutes.</li>
      <li><term>Increment</term> Seconds added to your time with each move.</li>
      <li><term>Rated game</term> The result of rated games affect your rating.
      Unrated games make no adjustment.</li>
      <li><term>Confirm manually</term> Allows you to confirm or deny a challenge.</li>
      <li><term>Color</term> Select whether to play White or Black or Auto.</li>
      <li><term>Limit rating between</term> Only play those with a given rating interval.</li>
      <li><term>Filter with formula</term> On FICS every player can
      set a formula that describes what challenges will be denied
      automatically. This formula can be enabled by checking this box.
      </li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Offers Graph</h3>

    <p>The <b>Offers Graph</b> button shows all current game offers. Hovering
your mouse over a node will show it's details, and clicking a node will
request a new game. Sometimes you'll have to be quick though, as
FICS can be quite busy.</p>

<p> On the graph itself, The y-axis shows the ELO rating of the opponent -
higher number means stronger player , while x-axis of the graph plots the time
allowed for the game. The first grey line marks standard <term>Blitz</term>
timing (5 min., no increment) while the second red line marks the standard
<term>Rapid</term> timing (15 min., no increment).
<p>
Additionally, the offers use the following coding:
    <ul>
       <li><green>Green</green>: offers from computer opponents</li>
       <li><blue>Blue</blue>: offers from human opponents</li>
       <li><red>Red</red>: games with a total time of more than 1 hour</li>
       <li><gray>Gray</gray>: anonymous offers, i.e. offers from guest logins</li>
       <li>Boxes: unrated games</li>
       <li>Circles: rated games</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

# FICS Find Opponent
set helpTitle(FICSobserve) "Other Features"
set helpText(FICSobserve) {<h1>Other Features</h1>

  <h3>Live International Events</h3>
  <p>
  From time to time FICS broadcasts major events in
  international chess, whence one can observe the games live.
  These events are handled by the special account, Relay.
  To find out what games are currently relayed , use
  <b>tell relay listgames</b>. Relay will reply with a table of current games.
Use <b>tell relay notify</b> if you want to be told what tournaments are being relayed when you login.
  </p>

<h3>Observing Games</h3>
  <p>
  The format for observing other games is
<b>observe player | game | /l | /b | /s | /S | /w | /z | /B | /L | /x</b>
<br>
where the options are:
<ul>
<li>game:   Observe the given game number</li>
<li>player: Observe the given players game</li>
<li>/l:     Observe the highest rated lightning game</li>
<li>/b:     Observe the highest rated blitz game</li>
<li>/s:     Observe the highest rated standard game</li>
<li>/S:     Observe the highest rated suicide game</li>
<li>/w:     Observe the highest rated wild game</li>
<li>/z:     Observe the highest rated crazyhouse game</li>
<li>/B:     Observe the highest rated bughouse game</li>
<li>/L:     Observe the highest rated losers game</li>
<li>/x:     Observe the highest rated atomic game </li>
</ul>
  One can also browse all current games using the <b>games</b> command, and type <b>unobserve</b> to stop following all games.
  </p>
  <br>
  Observed games are shown as small boards in Scid's FICS widget. The boards' size is controlled by a slider,
  and they have two small buttons:
  <ul>
  <li><img arrow_up> will load the game into Scid's main board, allowing analysis and saving of the game.
  <i>Note: Doing this with blitz games on slow internet connections can be
  troublesome, and it is disabled for </i><b>variants</b>.</li>
  <li><img arrow_close> Closes the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  For discussing games with other observers,
  <b>whisper</b> and <b>kibitz</b> can be used. All these conversations can be read in the console.
  </p>

  <h3><name exam>Examining and Loading Games</name></h3>

  <p>
  FICS and Scid vs. PC offer two ways to analyze games. Smoves and Examine.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>smoves</b> command loads a previously played or suspended game into the main board.
  Using "smoves GMShort -1" (for eg) is better in that the whole game is loaded to Scid, and 
  it can thus have variations added, and the game saved.
  </p>
  <p>
  The FICS <b>examine</b> command is now well supported, and is a convenient way
  for groups or friends to analyze games. After issuing  "examine GMShort -1" (for eg),
  Scid's large move buttons are bound to the FICS <b>forward</b> and <b>back</b> commands.
  </p>
  <p>
  One may upload a game to FICS using <b>upload</b>. This command sends the current game to FICS
  as a scratch game in examine mode. Others can then examine your game. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Crazyhouse and Bughouse games can only be observed or examined. They cannot be loaded
  into the main board with "smoves" because of limitations in Scid. Additionally, some 
crazyhouse positions have illegal FEN (for eg - because of more than 8 pawns)
and trying to run engines against such positions is not recommended.</i></p>

  <h3>Downloading Games</h3>
  <p>
  To download more than a handful of games, 
  <url http://www.ficsgames.org>www.ficsgames.org</url> is a great resource.
  </p>

  <h3>Lectures</h3>

  <p>
  FICS offers several options for chess training. One of the more
  prominent once are the lecture bots <b>LectureBot</b> and
  <b>WesBot</b>. They run all the time on FICS and offer various
  training sessions that can be visited using Scid. The start of each
  session is announced on <b>Channel 67</b> of FICS. Therefore,
  to see these announcements one should first add this channel to the
  personal observation list. This can be done by <b>+channel
  67</b> (it can be removed again by <b>-channel 67</b>).
  Once e.g. LectureBot announces a training session, one can take part
  by issuing <b>observe lecturebot</b>. Please refer to the
  online documentation of FICS for additional features of the Bots and
  also other bots available.

set helpText(FICSwidget) {<h1>Using FICS</h1>
  <p>
Once you have <a FICSlogin>logged in</a>, the main FICS widget shows a
console window, entry widget, and some command buttons.</p>

<h3>FICS Console</h3>
<p>
This is the main interface with the FICS server.
</p>

<p>
Interaction is via commands entered in the entry box, or by 
the Command Buttons. For an outline of popular commands see the
<a FICScommands>Commands</a> section.</p>

<h4>Console Colours</h4>
<p>
Normal messages are written in green; messages from other
players appear in red.  It can be a little confusing, but
toggling the <b>Tells</b> and <b>Shouts</b> boxes will make
it quieter.
</p>
<p>
One may also customize <b>the fore/background colours</b> from the main Options--<gt>FICS menu.
By default they are LimeGreen and grey35.
</p>
<h4>FICS Options</h4>
<p>
There are a few options in a right-click menu. 'No Requests'
denies Takebacks, Adjournment, Abort and Draw requests. 'No Results' prevents game results
dialogs.
</p>

  <h3>Buttons</h3>
  <p>
  On the right hand side of the clocks appear the command buttons. They are
fairly self explanatory, the most notable being the <a FICSfindopp>Find
Opponent and Offers Graph</a> buttons. Other buttons include:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><term>Tells</term> Show messages from channel tells</li>
    <li><term>Shouts</term> Show messages from shouts and cshouts</li>
    <li><term>Clear All</term> Clear console of previous messages</li>
    <li><term>Next</term> Send "next" for next page of help info</li>
    <li><term>Rematch</term> Request a rematch with previous opponent</li>
  </ul>

<h3><name premove>Premove</name></h3>
<p>
Premove allows one to decide your next move before your opponent has moved,
allowing for very quick play - essential for Blitz games.
</p><p>
In Scid vs. PC, premove is done by holding down the <b>Control</b> key and clicking
on the FROM and TO squares. A coloured line will be drawn, and - if legal -
this move will be played immediately your opponent has.
To cancel premove, press the <b>Escape</b> key.

# Book tuning
set helpTitle(BookTuning) "Book tuning"
set helpText(BookTuning) {<h1>Book Tuning</h1>
   <p><i>
   Opening Books are small databases recording moves at the start of a game and how often each move occurs. For more information, see 
<a Book>Book Window</a>.</i></p>

   <p>
   Using Scid's <run ::book::tuning><green>Book Tuning</green></run> feature, one
   can adjust the value associated with any move in an opening book.
</p>
   <p>
   To navigate through the branches of the book one can just click on
   the line in the book tuning window or move around the game as usual
   in Scid.
   </p>
   <p>
   To adjust the probability, e.g. rise the probability of a certain
   variation, one can just increase its value. Though the other values
   stay the same, Scid will recalculate once <b>Save</b> is
   pressed.
   </p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
   Only integer values are shown; a zero may signify that this move has a probability of less
   than 1%, and most likely happens with books automatically generated
   from game collections. One should also note that all values should add up to 100%.
   </p>
<h2>Exporting Books</h2>
   <p><i>For information about exporting multiple games to Polyglot Books, see
   the <a Book Polyglot>Polyglot</a> section.
   </i></p>
   <p>
   Choosing <b>Export</b> will export a branch of the book from
   the current position onwards <b>into a single game</b>. The continuation
   with the highest probability will make up the main line while all
   others are stored in variations. This allows for semi manually
   selecting lines to be included in a new book to be created. Note,
   that Scid can handle 3000 moves in a single game, therefore it will
   most likely not be possible (nor will it be very sensible) to
   export a whole opening book into one game. Also note that export
   can be done incrementally. That is, new lines are added to already
   existing ones. This also allows to merge several books.

   The Novag Citrine is a wooden chess board that can be interfaced
   from a PC by means of a serial connection. It can be used with Scid
   to enter games, play against a computer opponent or on FICS
   offering a "natural" chess interface.
   </p>
   <p>
   Before the board can be used, one has to configure the port to use
   (Tools / Novag Citrine / Configure). On Linux systems these ports
   are called /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 and so on for serial ports,
   /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 and so on for USB connections. On
   Windows the names COM1:, COM2: and so on are common. 
   </p>
   <p>
   Once the proper port is set, choose Tools / Novag Citrine / Connect
   to hook up the board.

   The feature relies on a slow and poorly maintained Tcl package, <b>Snack</b>,
   which should be installed by default on Windows and OSX. On Linux this package
   is known as "libsnack" and "tcl-snack". For more info, see below.
   </p>
   <p>
   To see if sound is enabled, examine the Start-up Window.
   The sound options are configured from the 
   <run ::utils::sound::OptionsDialog><green>Options--<gt>Sounds</green></run> menu.
   </p>
   <p>
   Sound may be disabled by selecting an invalid folder.
   </p>
   <h2>Linux Snack Issues</h2><p>
   If Scid only plays every second move, you have a buggy
   libsnack, and should compile snack-2.2.10 from
   <url https://sourceforge.net/projects/scidvspc/files/support files/>source</url>.
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li>* It should be installed in the same lib as tcl/tk (generally /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib).</li>
   <li>* If you get a compilation error in file generic/jkFormatMP3.c,
   move the "#include <lt>math.h<gt>" line in this file to above "#define roundf(x)".</li>
