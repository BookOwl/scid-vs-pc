    Scid has over seventy <a Index>help pages</a>. They are accessible
    by pressing <b>F1</b> in most windows.
  }
  {
    The main board has a handy right-click menu that allows
    one to show or hide various widgets.
  }
  {
    Scid offers you several ways to enter chess moves.
    You can use the mouse
    (with or without move suggestion), or keyboard
    (with or without move completion). Read the
    <a Moves>Move Entry</a> help item for details.
  }
  {
    For quick access to oft used databases, add
    <a Bookmarks>bookmarks</a> for each of them, and make sure the bookmark icon is
    visible in the toolbar (Options--<gt>Toolbar).
  }
  {
    You can see the moves, comments and variations of the current game
    in the <a PGN>PGN Window</a>.
    Using the middle mouse button on a move, shows
    a preview of that position.
  }
  {
    Copy games from one database to another using drag and drop
    in the <a Switcher>Database Switcher</a> (in the bottom of the gamelist).
    Dragging filtered games to the Clipbase allows one to sort the games without having to sort the
    whole base.
  }
  {
    Single-game PGN files can be saved via <b>File--<gt>Save PGN</b>
    But larger PGN files are always opened read-only.
    If you want to edit a PGN file in Scid, create a new database
    and copy the PGN games to it using the <a Switcher>database switcher</a>.
  }
  {
    The cut-off menu (dotted line) in the <green>File-<gt>Switch to Database</green> menu makes it a great little database switcher.
  }
  {
    The <a Tree>Tree Window</a> shows all moves played from the
    current position. To see the move orders
    that reached this position, generate an <a OpReport>Opening Report</a>.
  }
  {
   If you have a large database you often use with the <a Tree>Tree</a>,
   selecting <b>Fill Cache File</b> (from the Tree Menu) will greatly speed
   things up.
  }
  {
    In the main window, double-clicking on the Status Bar starts the (first)
    chess engine. Right-clicking docks/undocks the engine.
  }
  {
    Clicking on a player's name shows the <a PInfo>Player Information Window</a>.
    From here , one can easily select all games by the player 
    by clicking on the win/lose/filter values (in green).
  }
  {
    When studying an Opening, it can be useful to peform a
    <a Searches Board>Board Search</a> with the Pawns or
    Files option on an important position, as this may
    reveal other openings reaching the same pawn structure.
  }
  {
   The <a Maintenance Cleaner>Maintenance Cleaner</a> allows
   one to do several <a Maintenance>maintenance</a> jobs at the one time.
  }
  {
   The <a Maintenance Editing>Name Editor</a> allows one to substitute individual 
   Player and Event names (and more).
  }
  {
    Here's a sorting hint. If you have a large Database where most games have
    an Event Date To sort the games by date, consider <a
    Sorting>sorting</a> it by Event Date, then Event
    (instead of Date then Event), as
    this keeps games in the same tournament, but with different dates,
    together. (Assuming they all have the same EventDate).
  }
  {
    Before looking for <a Maintenance Twins>Twin Games</a>, it is a good idea
    to <a Maintenance Spellcheck>spell check</a> your database, as this
    allows Scid to better find twins.
  }
  {
    <a Flags>Flags</a> are useful for marking database games with
    particular characteristics , such as pawn structure, tactics, etc.
    This can be done in Scid vs. PC's gamelist. There are also 6 custom flags, whose labels can
    be changed in the <a Maintenance>Maintenance</a> window.
  } 
  {
    You can search for flagged or deleted games with the
    <a Searches Header>General Search</a> window.
    After saving Search Criteria with the <b>Save</b> button, these saves can then
     be reloaded later from Scid's main <b>Search Menu</b>.
  }
  {
    If you are playing through a game and want to quickly try out some moves
    , simply turn on Trial mode (with the
    <b>Control-Space</b> shortcut or the buttonbar icon). Turning it off
    again returns the game to it's original state.
  }
  {
    To find the most important games (with high-rated opponents)
    reaching a certain position, open the <a Tree>Tree Window</a>
    and then the Best Games widget. You can even restrict
    theese games to show only a particular result.
  }
  {
    A great way to study an opening using a large database of games is
    to turn on training mode in the <a Tree>Tree Window</a>. Then play
    against the database to see which lines most often occur.
  }
  {
    The <a Tmt>Tournament Finder</a> not only finds
    a particular tournament, but can also show what tournaments
    a player has recently competed in, or browse the top
    tournaments played in a particular country.
  }
  {
    There are a number of common patterns defined in the
    <a Searches Material>Material/Pattern</a> search window that you
    may find useful for openings or middlegame study.
  }
  {
    When searching for material differences in the
    <a Searches Material>Material/Pattern</a> search window, pay attention
    to the "Half moves" entry, to eliminate games where the difference
    only occurs briefly.
  }
  {
    Important databases can be made <b>Read-Only</b>
    from the <b>File</b> menu (after opening it), or by changing
    the bases file permissions through Windows/Linux/OSX.
  }
  {
    If you use XBoard , the quickest way to copy a  chess position to Scid
    is to select <b>Copy Position</b> from Xboard's File menu 
    , then <b>Paste FEN</b> from Scid's Edit menu.
  }
  {
    In a <a Searches Header>General Search</a>, Player/Event/Site/Round
    Names are case-insensitive and match anywhere in a name. You can choose
    to do more precise searches using double-quotes and the wildcards
    "?" (any single character) and "*" (zero or more characters)
    For example, searching for <b>belg</b> (in the site field) shows many matches
    but <b>"*Belgium*" shows fewer matches.
  }
  {
    If you want to correct a move in a game without losing all the moves
    played after it, open the <a Import>Import Window</a>, press the
    <b>Paste current game</b> button, edit the incorrect move and then
    press <b>Import</b>.
  }
  {
    If you have an ECO classification file loaded, you can go to the
    deepest classified position in the current game with
    <b>Identify Opening</b> in the <b>Game</b> menu
    (shortcut: Control-Shift-D).
  }
  {
    If you want to check the size of a file or its date of last modification
    before opening it, open the <a Finder>File Finder</a> with <b>Control-/</b>.
  }
  {
    An <a OpReport>Opening Report</a> is great for learning more about
    a particular position. You can see how well it scores, whether it
    leads to frequent short draws, and common positional themes.
  }
  {
    You can add the most common annotation symbols (!, !?, +=, etc) to the
    current move or position with keyboard shortcuts without needing to
    use the <a Comment>comment editor<a> -- for example, type "!" then
    the Return key to add a "!" annotation symbol. See the
    <a Moves>Entering Chess Moves</a> help page for details.
  }
  {
    If you are browsing openings in a database with the <a Tree>Tree</a>,
    you can see a useful overview of how well the current opening is
    scoring recently and between high-rated players by opening the
    Statistics window (<b>Control-I</b>).
  }
  {
    You can resize the main board size with <b>Control+Wheelmouse</b>, or by
    <b>Control-Shift-Left/Right</b>.
  }
  {
    After a <a Searches>search</a>, you can browse through all
    matching games with <b>Control-Up/Down</b> to load the previous/next
    <a Filter>filter</a> game.
  }
  {
    Scid vs. PC makes <a Tourney>Computer Tournaments</a> between numerous opponents possible.
    To select extra opponents, change the "Number of Engines", then press "Update".
    Short games can be played by entering (for example) .5 minutes , for 30 second games.
