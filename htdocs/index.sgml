<bf>Shane's Chess Information Database</bf> is a powerful Chess Toolkit, with
which one can create huge chess databases, run engine analysis, or play
casual games against the computer or online with the Free Internet Chess
Server. It was originally written by Shane Hudson , and has received strong
contribution from Pascal Georges and others.

<url url="http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/" name="Scid vs. PC"> is a usability
and bug-fix fork of Scid.  The project is maintained by <ref name="Stevenaaus"
id="contact_">, and has been extensively tested with the Million Base and ICOfY databases.

<sect> features <p>

<em>See <ref name="changes" id="changes_"> for a comprehensive changelog, or the 
<url url="https://sourceforge.net/apps/gallery/scidvspc/index.php" name="gallery"> for some screenshots.
</em>.

<sect2>New / Improved features over Scid

<itemize>
<item> <bf>Computer Tournaments</bf>.
<item> Rewritten <bf>Gamelist</bf> widget: deleted items are greyed, a <bf>Compact</bf> button, <bf>Flag</bf> widgets, and the <bf>Database Switcher</bf> resides here.
<item> Improved <bf>Tactical Game</bf> and <bf>FICs</bf> features.
<item> Clickable <bf>Variation Arrows</bf>, and <bf>Paste Variation</bf> feature.
<item> Improved Undo and <bf>Redo</bf> features
<item> <bf>Ratings Graph</bf> can show multiple players
<item> Book tuning <bf>Remove Move</bf> feature
<item> Separate board sections are hideable via right-click.
<item> A re-done <bf>Button Bar</bf> with nicer look and feel.

<em>The latest code is available from subversion - </em> <bf>svn co https://scidvspc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scidvspc</bf>

<sect> installation <p>

<em>Scid vs. PC requires <url name="Tcl/Tk" url="http://tcl.tk"> 8.5.
It should work with 8.6 , but is untested.</em>


<sect2> Linux , FreeBSD<p>

Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk installed by default.
To verify this, look for a command named <bf>wish</bf> or <bf>wish8.5</bf>. (Wish-8.5.10 is not recommended).
To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may need to install
<url name="TkImg" url="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&amp;filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2">.  
Then, installing from source:
<code>
tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.6.tgz
cd scid_vs_pc-4.6
configure
make install
scid
</code>

<em>It is also possible to install Scid vs. PC into <bf>/usr</bf>, instead of the normal <bf>/usr/local</bf>.
This allows for parallel installation with mainline Scid, and is done by: <bf>./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/ SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/</bf>
<newline><newline>Scid's multi-language support can cause problems. Chinese (and other) users should use: <bf>./configure LANGUAGES=""</bf></em>


<sect2> Windows <p>
Windows installation simply requires downloading the <ref name="executable" id="download_">, and following the prompts.
</p>
<p>
To use the extra chess pieces, <bf>Wish8.5</bf> must be installed. I recommend the excellent
<url url="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads" name="Active State Tcl">.
</p>
<p>
The configuration files, <bf>including the chess engine list</bf>, are stored in the <bf>Scid-vs-PC/bin/config</bf> directory, and may be copied
over from old versions to make upgrading easier.
</p>

<sect2> Mac OSX <p>

The <ref name="ScidvsMac-4.6 app" id="download_"> should include everything you need. Simply drag and drop the App into /Applications (or similar).

<em>Users upgrading may have to remove (or edit) <bf>$HOME/.scidvspc/config/engines.dat</bf>
to properly configure the chess engines.</em>

To compile from source - once you have XCode installed - please read <bf>ScidvsMac-HowTo.rtfd</bf> in the source tarball.

Thanks to Gilles for the web page restructure and OSX testing. Gregor Cramer <url url="http://scidb.sf.net"> has contributed a PGN figurine feature.

<bf> April 19, 2011 </bf>

A belated thanks to Lee from Sourceforge for 
<url url="http://sourceforge.net/blog/after-scid-row-a-new-chess-app-is-born/" name="this article">.

<bf> December 10, 2010 </bf>

Sicd vs. PC 4.2 includes support for Scid's si4 db format.

<bf> July 3, 2010 </bf>

For the tenth release I've adopted verison number 4.0 .  It includes a new Computer Tournament feature (thanks to some UCI snippets from Fulvio) and the Gamelist Widget is finally up-to-speed for large databases.

<bf> April 19, 2010 </bf>

Release 3.6.26.9 includes a Fics accept/decline offers widget.

<bf> December 20, 2009 </bf>

Thanks to Dorothy for making me a Mac DMG package with this release , 3.6.26.8.

<bf> August 16, 2009 </bf>

With 3.6.26.6 I've fixed Phalanx's illegal castling. There is also changes to the Setup board and Toolbar configuration widgets.

<bf> July 17, 2009 </bf>

3.6.26.5 - New Gamelist widget, and re-fashioned main buttons. Project's looking quite solid :-> 

<bf> June 23, 2009 </bf>

The monkey on my back has really been having a good time.  This release includes changes to the Gameinfo, Comment Editor, and Board Style widgets, some new chess pieces, colour schemes and tiles. Thanks to Michal and Alex for feedback.

<bf> June 4, 2009 </bf>

Well, the html is up, and i've got a couple of
files in the downloads section. My project is fairly modest fork of Scid
... just rewriting Tk widgets when i get the urge.

<sect> miscellaneous <p>

<sect1> how to play <p>

<descrip>

<tag/Playing against the Computer/
The main Computer vs. Player feature is accessed from <bf>Play->Tactical
Game</bf>.  Here you'll find the option to start a new game (or Fischer
Chess game), against a flexible computer opponent whose skill you can
select.  Skill levels vary between 1200 (a bright teenager with some
experience), to 2200 (a National Master).

<tag/Playing on the Internet/
Playing on the Internet is done via the the
<bf>Play->Internet</bf> menu item. I recommend visiting the <url
url="http://www.freechess.org" name="Fics"> website to create a user
account, but it is also possible to play anonymously. To start a game,
press the <bf>Login as Guest</bf> button, then watch the available games as they are
announced in the console. Enter <bf>play [game number]</bf> to accept a
game challenge.

</descrip>

<em>There is more information
about the Fics and Tactical Game features in the Scid Help menus</em>.


<sect1> known issues <p>
<itemize>
<item> <bf>Chinese Language Support</bf>. Scid's multilanguage support is broken
for some countries. The work around involves compiling from source, using:
<em>./configure LANGUAGES=""</em>
<newline>Alternatively, remove all lines between "### deutsch.tcl" and "# end of russian.tcl" in the scid.gui file.
<item> <bf>Focus Issues</bf>. Kde users can allow Tcl apps to properly raise themselves by
configuring <i>desktop > window behavior > advanced > focus stealing prevention</i>
set to "none"
</itemize>

<sect1> bugs <p>

<itemize>
<item> Using the '+' operator and clicking on 'Find' in the gamelist widget can be very slow. The code needs to be moved from gamelist.tcl to tkscid.cpp.
<item> Wish-8.5.10 has nasty bugs (which affect the gamelist and setup board widgets) and is not recommended.
<item> Windows only:
<itemize>
<item> Using "ALT+F"... etc key bindings to access the menus is badly broke. This is a Tcl/Tk issue.
<item> Window focus/raise issues, another Tcl/Tk issue. 
</itemize>
<item> There is no drag-and-drop file opening.
</itemize>

</p>

<sect1> scid's history <p>

<p>Scid is a huge project, with an interesting history. Originally authored by
Shane Hudson from New Zealand, it combined the power of Tk's GUI and
the speed of C, to produce a free Chess Database application with 
Opening Reports, Tree Analysis, and Tablebase support.
It gained quite some attention, as it was arguably the first project of it's
kind; but after writing over a hundred thousand lines of code, in 2004 development
stopped. Shane never contributed to Scid again. He was generally reported
to be seriously ill, and today has little if no contact with the current Scid community.</p>
<p> Two new versions of Scid appeared around 2006. The first was ChessDB
authored by Dr. David Kirby. With some good documentation and 
the ability to automatically download games from
several web portals, it became popular. But at the same time Pascal Georges from France
was making strong technical improvements to Scid. Frustrated with Scid's dormancy,
and because of disagreements with ChessDB's author, Pascal released his own tree, Scid-pg, which 
included UCI support and numerous Player versus Computer features.</p>
<p> But subtley, and with some controversy, he began to adopt the name Scid as his own. Some
people objected, especially Dr. Kirby, with whom a flame war began, but 
Pascal's efforts to gain ownership of the Sourceforge Scid project eventually succeeded.</p>
<p>Under Pascal, and with the help of numerous contributors, Scid again strode
forward. Pascal wrote a Tree Mask feature, and in 2009
he upgraded the database format to si4, all the time making speed and technical improvements
to the neglect of the interface. Very recently, Pascal has contributed less
to the project, but it still thrives as a feature rich database application,
with a strong community headed by a core group of programmers.</p>
<p>But along the way, there exist other Scid projects. Chessx, by Michal Rudolf from
Germany, is a rewrite of Scid using the powerful libQT API, popularized by KDE-4.
Originally called Newscid, Chessx still grows, but with a much smaller feature set,
and lesser popularity than Scid.</p>
<p>Scid vs. PC (by Steven Atkinson from Australia) began around mid 2009. It
was started in response to Scid's poor User Interface and bloated design.
Forked from Scid-3.6.26, it has some new features and regular updates from
Scid, but is mostly an effort to tidy Shane's frenetic code base, improve the user interface
, and add polish to Scid's rich feature set.</p>
<p>But another chapter is yet to be written. A serious effort is being made to
rewrite Scid, including Chessbase support. This project is Scidb, by Gregor
Cramer from Germany, and many are looking forward to it's first release.</p>
