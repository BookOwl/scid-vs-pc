<P><B>Shane's Chess Information Database</B> is a powerful Chess Toolkit, with
which one can create huge chess databases, run engine analysis, or play

contribution from Pascal Georges and others.</P>

<H3>Improvements over Scid</H3>

<UL>
<LI> A <B>Computer Tournament</B> feature.</LI>
<LI> Rewritten <B>Gamelist</B> widget: deleted items are greyed, a <B>Compact</B> button, <B>Flag</B> widgets, and the <B>Database Switcher</B> resides here.</LI>
<LI> Improved <B>Tactical Game</B> and <B>FICs</B> features.</LI>
<LI> Clickable <B>Variation Arrows</B>, and <B>Paste Variation</B> feature.</LI>

<div class="tabContent" id="toc4">
<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">Installation </A></H2>

<div>
<P><EM>Scid vs. PC requires 
<A HREF="http://tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</A> 8.5.
It should work with 8.6 , but is untested.</EM></P>

<P>
<H3>Linux , FreeBSD</H3>


<P>Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk installed by default.
To verify this, look for a command named <B>wish</B> or <B>wish8.5</B>.
To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may need to install
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&amp;filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2">TkImg</A>.  
Then, installing from source:
<HR>
<PRE>
tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.4.1.tgz
cd scid_vs_pc-4.4.1
configure
make install
scid
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P><EM>It is also possible to install Scid vs. PC into <B>/usr</B>, instead of the normal <B>/usr/local</B>.
This allows for parallel installation with mainline Scid, and is done by: <B>./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/ SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/</B><BR><BR>
Scid's multi-language support can cause problems. Chinese (and other) users should use: <B>./configure LANGUAGES=""</B></EM></P>

<P>
<H3>Windows </H3>

<P>First you must install <B>Wish8.5</B>. I recommend the excellent
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/">Active State Tcl</A>.</P>
<P>Then unzip 
<A HREF="#toc3" OnClick="showTab2('#toc3');">Scid vs. PC</A>, browse to the <B>Scid-vs-PC/bin</B> directory and double click <B>Scid.exe</B>.</P>
<P>The configuration files, <B>including the chess engine list</B>, are stored in the <B>Scid-vs-PC/bin/config</B> directory, and may be copied
over from old versions to make upgrading easier.</P>
<H3>Mac OSX </H3>


<P>Mac users may have Tcl/Tk already installed. If not, I recommend trying
<A HREF="http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/">http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/</A>.</P>
<P>Then, one may compile from source, or install the App from the 
<A HREF="#toc3" OnClick="showTab2('#toc3');">downloads</A> section.
<EM>Note: Users upgrading may have to remove (or edit) <B>$HOME/.scidvspc/config/engines.dat</B>
to properly configure the chess engines.</EM></P>
<P>To compile from source - once you have the developer tools installed from your
OSX disk - following the Linux instructions should work. </P>
<P><B>Note</B> Tcl/Tk 8.5.7 (shipped with Snow Leopard) has bugs which break Scid vs. PC when loading PGN archives and Databases. Users installing from source should upgrade their Tcl frameworks to 8.5.9.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="#toc6.5">scid's history </A>
</H2>

<div>

<P>Scid is a huge project, with an interesting history. Originally authored by
Shane Hudson from New Zealand, it combined the power of Tk's GUI and
the speed of C, to produce a free Chess Database application with 
Opening Reports, Tree Analysis, and Tablebase support.
It gained quite some attention, as it was arguably the first project of it's
kind; but after writing over a hundred thousand lines of code, in 2004 development
stopped. Shane never contributed to Scid again. He was generally reported
to be seriously ill, and today has little if no contact with the current Scid community.</P>
<P> Two new versions of Scid appeared around 2006. The first was ChessDB
authored by Dr. David Kirby. With some good documentation and 
the ability to automatically download games from
several web portals, it became popular. But at the same time Pascal Georges from France
was making strong technical improvements to Scid. Frustrated with Scid's dormancy,
and because of disagreements with ChessDB's author, Pascal released his own tree, Scid-pg, which 
included UCI support and numerous Player versus Computer features.</P>
<P> But subtley, and with some controversy, he began to adopt the name Scid as his own. Some
people objected, especially Dr. Kirby, with whom a flame war began, but 
Pascal's efforts to gain ownership of the Sourceforge Scid project eventually succeeded.</P>
<P>Under Pascal, and with the help of numerous contributors, Scid again strode
forward. Pascal wrote a Tree Mask feature, and in 2009
he upgraded the database format to si4, all the time making speed and technical improvements
to the neglect of the interface. Very recently, Pascal has contributed less
to the project, but it still thrives as a feature rich database application,
with a strong community headed by a core group of programmers.</P>
<P>But along the way, there exist other Scid projects. Chessx, by Michal Rudolf from
Germany, is a rewrite of Scid using the powerful libQT API, popularized by KDE-4.
Originally called Newscid, Chessx still grows, but with a much smaller feature set,
and lesser popularity than Scid.</P>
<P>Scid vs. PC (by Steven Atkinson from Australia) began around mid 2009. It
was started in response to Scid's poor User Interface and bloated design.
Forked from Scid-3.6.26, it has some new features and regular updates from
Scid, but is mostly an effort to tidy Shane's frenetic code base, improve the user interface
, and add polish to Scid's rich feature set.</P>
<P>But another chapter is yet to be written. A serious effort is being made to
rewrite Scid, including Chessbase support. This project is Scidb, by Gregor
Cramer from Germany, and many are looking forward to it's first release.</P>
