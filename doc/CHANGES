ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I used to have here a list of thanks to people who have contributed
suggestions, bug reports, translations, etc, but it is now in the
THANKS file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SUMMARY OF SCID CHANGES BY VERSION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.6: (February 2003)

 -   Major cleanup of the user interface code.

 -   Improved layout of some dialog windows which were too tall
     for 800x600 screens.

 -   Revamped the Comment Editor window, to make adding marks and annotation
     symbols easier.

 -   Improved the database switcher window; it is now fully resizable
     and only displays open databases.

 -   Increased the maximum number of open databases to 9, including the
     clipbase.

 -   Added comboboxes to recall history of past values in some entry boxes,
     e.g. White/Black/Event/Site in the Header Search field. The past value
     histories are saved between sessions.

 -   Minor interface improvements, e.g. more consistent button sizes.

 -   Fixed pasting of a position in FEN (with Ctrl+Shift+V) which worked
     in Linux but was broken in Windows.

 -   Improved sorting of round names. If two rounds are equal up to a decimal
     point, Scid first tries to interpret the text after the dot as a number;
     for example "4.10" used to be sorted between "4.1" and "4.2" but now
     it comes after "4.9".

 -   Added move announcement sounds. This was surprisingly easy, using the
     Tcl/Tk "Snack" sound package.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.5: (December 2003)

 -   New "Player Report" window, similar to an opening report but
     for a particular player instead of an opening.

 -   Opening Report window: New "Favorites" menu.

 -   New option: "My Player Names" under "Options/Chesboard" menu.

 -   Windows version: Scid now has its own icon, and the installer now
     creates file associations for Scid database (.si3/.sg3/.sn3) files.

 -   Help pages: Renamed Index to Contents; added an Index help page.

 -   Added new search boxes (for Event and Maximum mean Elo) to the
     Tournament Finder.

 -   Many minor user interface improvements.

 -   Cleaned up config/data/log file names and locations.

 -   Lots of bug fixes and other small improvements, many contributed by
     Michal Rudolf and others.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.4: (January 2003)

 -   Scid now comes with its own built-in chess engine called Scidlet
     which is used in Scid to suggest moves (for fast mouse move entry)
     and is also available as a WinBoard engine outside of Scid.

 -   New window: Player Finder, which lists information about players
     in the current database.

 -   Edit menu: Added "Copy position" (to complement the existing
     "Paste start board" command) which copies the current position
     to the clipboard/X-selection in FEN notation.

 -   Moves on the main window chessboard are now animated. Use the
     "Options / Moves / Animate time" menu to configure the
     animation speed.

 -   Added a board toolbar icon to optionally show or hide a small
     box beside the board showing the side to move.

 -   Tree window has a new column showing the percentage of draws.

 -   Maintenance window: added Description field, for storing a
     short (up to around 100 characters) database description.

 -   Added MouseWheel support. In main window, Wheel moves backwards
     and forwards in the current game. Wheel scrolls vertically in
     most windows: Game List, Crosstable, PGN, Opening Report, etc.

 -   Fixed bookmarks so they should now load the correct game
     even if game numbers are changed by compacting or sorting
     a database.

 -   Added optional small analysis board to the Analysis window
     showing the position at the end of the best line of play.
     Also added "Low CPU priority" checkbox to Analysis window.

 -   Tablebase window: added option of displaying a "results board";
     select a piece on the board to show tablebase results for that
     piece relocated to any empty square on the board.

 -   Game browser windows now have an autoplay button.

 -   Added a black border around chessboard squares, with a user
     settable width in the Options/Colors... dialog box.

 -   Added a toolbar to the repertoire editor window.

 -   Added support for null moves, with the option of preserving
     them in PGN export (which is non-standard since there is no
     PGN standard for null moves) or converting them to comments
     for compliance with other software.

 -   When importing PGN, if a game has a castling move that is not
     strictly legal because the rook or king had already moved, Scid
     now accepts the move but logs a warning message. Previously, it
     would report an error and not import any more moves from the
     game. This was changed because such castling is fairly common
     and is the most common cause of illegal moves in master games.

 -   Now supports reading of multiple player photo (.spf) files.

 -   Improved handling of en passant fields in EPD records.

 -   More translatable messages for multi-language support.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.3: (May 2002)

 a.  New "Piece Tracker" tool, for finding which squares a
     particular piece (or all pieces of a certain type) most
     frequently moves to, in games in the filter.

 b.  New "Filter Graph" window, showing trends (by decade, recent
     year or rating) for games in the current filter.

 c.  Opening Report: "View LaTeX" now uses dvips and ghostview
     instead of xdvi.

 d.  Improvements to font selection.

 e.  Added option to strip [%arrow ...] and [%mark ...] codes
     out of comments in PGN window and export files.

 f.  The Exit dialog now alerts the user to any databases with
     unsaved game changes.

 g.  More crosstable options. You can choose to show or ignore deleted
     games. Also, in all-play-all crosstables, column titles can now be
     configured to be partial player surnames or numbers.

 h.  Delete twins: added options controlling which game to delete for
     each pair of twin games. Also squashed a small but annoying bug
     that was causing Scid to miss some twin games (thanks Gerard!)

 i.  Added "Load previous game" and "Load next game" toolbar icons.
     Also made the toolbar more configurable: you can choose which
     icons should be displayed.

 j.  Twin checker: added "Share tags" button for combining the tag
     information of a pair of twin games.

 k.  Opening report window now shows a small board with the report
     position. Clicking the left mouse button on the board flips it.
     This allows saving of opening reports in LaTeX or HTML format
     with the board displayed from the Black perspective.

 l.  Fixed a few small bugs, including rounding of performance
     ratings in crosstables.

 m.  Maintenance window: new "Strip PGN tags" operation that finds
     extra PGN tags and allows the user to remove all instances of
     a particular unwanted tag.

 n.  For Unix users: a new script, "sc_remote" which opens a Scid
     database or PGN file in an existing, running Scid instance
     where possible, avoiding opening the same database twice.
     Contributed by Mark Oakden.

 o.  Added "Load Random Game" menu command in the Game menu. This
     loads a random game from the current filter.

 p.  Improved the Tablebase window; it now shows which tablebases are
     available, provides a way to select a tablebase for examination,
     and has an information summary for most tablebases.

 q.  Added a Recent files list to the main window File menu.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.2: (February 2002)

 a.  Material search: added ability to specify a material difference,
     where Q=9 points, R=5, B=N=3 and P=1. Useful for finding
     specific endgames (like Rook vs Rook) where one side is up a
     pawn, for example.

 b.  Header search: added fields for searching by the FIDE title of
     each player. It does not yet take into account the year in which
     a player received a title, but should be fairly useful anyway.
     Also added a Game number range, for easy selection of the first
     or last games in a database.

 c.  New "Merge game" feature, available from the Game List right
     mouse menu (and also from the Best games list of the Tree window)
     for adding the selected game as a variation of the current game.
     Useful for annotating the opening of a game.

 d.  New "Browse game" feature, available from the Game List right
     mouse menu, Best games list of the tree window, Crosstable
     and Opening Report. This opens the selected game in a separate
     window for browsing, without affecting the current loaded game.
     This is useful for previewing a game before loading it, and for
     comparing games. The is no limit to the number of "Browse game"
     windows that can be open at the same time.

 e.  Keyboard move entry: Ctrl+Backspace now retracts a move, just
     like the right mouse button in the chessboard area. Also fixed
     a bug for cases where a pawn and Bishop capture clash (e.g. both
     bxc4 and Bxc4 are possible) so both moves can be entered with the
     keyboard; previously, the Bishop capture could be entered from
     the keyboard but the pawn move required mouse move entry.

 f.  Mouse move entry: if "Show suggested moves" is turned off, you
     can now use two left mouse button clicks or dragging between
     two squares to enter moves. Previously, only dragging worked
     with the left mouse button. Also, a selected piece now moves
     following the mouse cursor when dragging.

 g.  You can now draw arrows between squares with special commands in
     comments e.g. "[%arrow g1 f3 red]".

 h.  Spellcheck results window: you can now choose whether to show
     ambiguous corrections.

 i.  Improved reading of annotations in PGN: some which were causing
     errors if they appeared after a move without a leading space are
     now accepted without errors.

 j.  Improved Tree caching so it should now be faster to move back
     and forward in a game when the Tree is open on a large database.

 k.  Most tall Scid windows have been altered to work better with a
     smaller resolution such as 800x600, which is common on laptops.

 l.  Large databases should now load a bit faster.

 m.  You can now specify up to four tablebase directories.

 n.  Cleaned up the Scid programming interface; there is now a
     documentation file (http://scid.sourceforge.net/doc/progref.html)
     explaining the programming interface for users who want to write
     programs in Tcl/Tk that access Scid databases.

 o.  New translated languages: Swedish and Norsk. Also, French and
     Netherlands have been updated for the first time in a while.

 p.  Options / Windows menu: new "Auto-iconify" option for turning off
     the feature ("d." below) added in 3.1 which iconifies all other
     Scid windows when the main window is iconified, as a few window
     managers seem to have trouble with this.

 q.  The length of each game (in halfmoves) as stored in the Index file
     used to be limited to 255, so any game with more than 128 moves
     would appear in the Game List or Header searches to only have 128
     moves. This has been fixed for 3.2. To update an existing database
     to have correct values, compact its game file.

 r.  Much-improved Analysis engine selection. You can now choose where
     each engine should be started and sort the Engines list by name,
     estimated Elo rating or the date when it was last used.
     Also improved Engine communication, so Scid should work better
     with a wider range of WinBoard engines now.

 s.  Comment editor: added "Insert mark" button for marking a square
     or drawing an arrow on the board.

 t.  Improved the look of piece images in the chessboard.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.1: (December 2001)

 a.  Opening report improvements: now in color and with many clickable
     items for selecting or loading games. You can also now exclude an
     uninteresting move from being shown in the theory table.

 b.  A few improvements to Scid interaction with analysis engines.

 c.  Small fix to autoplay mode, to make it stop when the end of the
     current game or variation is reached.

 d.  Scid now iconifies all open Scid windows when the main window is
     iconified, and deiconifies them all when the main window is
     deiconified. This makes it easy to hide and show all open Scid
     windows with one mouse click.

 e.  Added a new crosstable display mode, "Auto", which automatically
     chooses the best table format (All-play-all or Swiss) for the
     current tournament. Auto is now the default display mode.
     Also, All-play-all mode has been improved for two-player matches.

 f.  Each Scid database can now store the number of the game to be
     auto-loaded whenever the database is opened. This option is
     settable from the Maintenance window.

 g.  You can now color squares with special commands in comments,
     e.g. "[%mark g4 blue]", "[%mark h2 #000070]", etc.

 h.  Annotate dialog (from the Analysis window) now offers the choice
     of only adding a variation for moves by one side, or when the
     first move of the line chosen by the analysis engine is not the
     same as the game move.

 i.  The game information area now has an option for showing the
     full comment for the current position, instead of only its
     first few words.

 j.  The Game List window is now user-configurable; just press the
     left or right mouse button on a column title for a menu.

 k.  Updated a few out-of-date help pages.

 l.  With keyboard move entry and auto-completion mode turned on,
     Scid now beeps when adding each move.

 m.  Fixed a few other small bugs from version 3.0.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 3.0: (November 2001)

 a.  Improved index file format (see details below). Databases created
     with Scid 2.x can be upgraded to the new format when they are
     first opened in Scid 3.0.

 b.  12 new user-settable "flags" for marking games with various chess
     characteristics: tactics, pawn structure, interesting endgames,
     kingside attacks, etc.

 c.  The EventDate tag is now stored in the index file, so it can be
     used for sorting a database.

 d.  Index format improvements have made tree searches faster for
     most common early opening positions.

 e.  The improved index format has made most simple endgame searches
     faster, e.g. for my 500,000-game database, finding all Knight and
     pawns vs Knight+pawns endgames improved from 2.4 to 1.7 seconds.

 f.  The game list can now display an estimate of how many comments,
     variations and annotation symbols each game has, not just whether
     it has any.

 g.  Find Novelty: can now choose to search all games or only games
     older than the current game.

 h.  Added Edit menu commands to strip all comments or variations
     from the current game.

 i.  Tree window: New "Best games" window, listing the highest-rated
     games in the currently displayed tree branch.

 j.  PGN window: Pressing the middle or right mouse button anywhere
     now pops up a window showing the board position at that location
     in the game.

 k.  Opening Reports: a few small format improvements, and more options
     for customising the report sections. The options are now saved to
     the user options file.

 l.  The Email manager can send mail using SMTP instead of sendmail, so
     it can now also be used with Windows systems. (Thanks Kayvan!)

 m.  Analysis added from an analysis window to the current game is now
     added as a real variation (used to only be added as a comment).

 n.  The Database Switcher orientation can now be changed (from
     horizontal to vertical stacking of databases) using its
     right-mouse menu.

 o.  New "Bookmarks" feature, for bookmarking important games.

 p.  The Header search can now search the PGN representation of each
     game for matching text, enabling searches for text in the extra
     PGN tags or comments of a game.

 q.  A new "Tip of the day" window, which shows a random hint.

 r.  Some of the most commonly-used windows (the switcher, PGN,
     and tree window) can now set to automatically open at startup.

 s.  Most window locations and sizes are now saved in the options
     file when "Save Options" is selected.

 t.  Fixed a rare bug that could cause game data corruption when
     copying games using the Database Switcher window. (Thanks Jens!)

 u.  Unix: user files are now stored in the directory "~/.scid", so
     the options file is now "~/.scid/scidrc" instead of "~/.scid".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.7: (October 2001)

 a.  New feature: "File Finder" window, for easier finding and
     opening of Scid databases, PGN, EPD, and Repertoire files.

 b.  New feature: "Tournament finder" window, showing tournaments
     that meet certain criteria (date, country, average rating, number
     of players, etc).

 c.  New "Paste start board" command for easier importing of a
     starting position copied from another program such as XBoard.

 d.  Added new optional "column" style for the PGN window and exported
     games (LaTeX, HTML or PGN format), which prints the game moves
     in columns with one move of each side per line. Also a couple
     of improvements to the display of variations in LaTeX format.

 e.  New feature: "Find Novelty", for finding the first move in the
     current game not played in any games of the selected database.

 f.  Analysis window: Added new frame showing history of evaluations
     for the current position.

 g.  Board search: added "Ignore colors" option, to search for the
     current position with the board flipped and colors reversed.

 h.  Added option to print player ages in crosstables. Ages are
     computed from spelling file data.

 i.  Improved graph windows, and added ability to save Tree, Ratings
     and Score graphs to a color or greyscale PostScript file.

 j.  Improved interface for selection of board and piece colors,
     including a number of predefined schemes suggested by users.

 k.  Scid now adds a default extension (html/pgn/tex/sor) when
     saving a file, if the user entered a filename with no extension.

 l.  Scid no longer asks for confirmation when copying games to the
     clipbase, but still asks when copying to any other database.

 m.  Opening report: now even more configurable options.

 n.  PGN importing: now accepts (and ignores) en-passent indicators,
     as in "exd6ep", "exd6 ep", "exd6e.p.", and "exd6 e.p.".
     Also now accepts a non-breaking space character (ASCII code 160)
     as whitespace.

 o.  Bug fix: Training mode with an analysis engine was not playing
     King moves.

 p.  The File Open menu command can now open any type of file Scid
     can use: Scid databases, PGN, EPD, and Repertoire files.

 q.  Added Tie-break scores option to crosstables, for printing
     Sonneborn-Berger scores in All-play-all tables and Bucholz
     (sum of opponents points) scores in Swiss tables.

 r.  Bugfix: a long tag in a game exported in PGN format could wrap to
     the next line; it now always printed on one line.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.6: (August 2001)

 a.  A new toolbar in the main window for fast easy access to
     commonly-used menu functions.

 b.  New feature: a "Lock" button in the Tree window, for locking the
     Tree to the current database. With this, you can use one database
     while seeing the Tree of another database.

 c.  The Email Manager now lets you keep track of when you received
     and sent email messages.

 d.  The Game Export functions (in the Tools menu) now have extra user
     configurable options: whether to use symolic annotations (for
     example, "! +=" instead of "$2 $14"), and whether to indent
     variations and comments. Also, with HTML export you can choose
     from two diagram styles.

 e.  Crosstables can now be saved in LaTeX format; previously they
     could only be saved as HTML or plain text.

 f.  Twin detection can now optionally compare only the first four
     letters of each name when comparing player names, instead of
     requiring an exact match. This helps to detect many more twin
     games which no not have the same exact spelling of player names.

 g.  Games with a non-standard start position can now be detected as
     twin games. I cannot remember why they ever were excluded from
     twin detection, or see any good reason to keep excluding them.

 h.  Some changes to analysis engine code to try and avoid freezing
     Scid when navigating a game very quickly while an analysis
     window is open.

 i.  ECO classification: you can now choose to reclassify only games
     played in the last year or month, which is useful for speeding
     up reclassification after adding new games to a large database.

 j.  New "Cleaner" command from the Maintenance window, which lets
     you initiate a sequence of maintenance functions on a database that
     Scid will perform without requiring user interaction.

 k.  You can now resize the main window height to change the height
     of the game information area below the chessboard. Also, the
     first few words of a comment are now displayed in this area,
     e.g. "(comment: A good move since...)" instead of just
     indicating there is a comment with "(comment)".

 l.  Clicking the left-mouse button on the main window status bar
     now cycles to the next database slot.

 m.  Added John Wiegley's "pgnfix" program (that cleans up PGN files)
     and "eco2pgn" (converts scid.eco to a PGN file) to the scripts
     directory.

 n.  New "Trial" mode ("Try variation"), for trying out a temporary
     variation without actually changing the current game.
  
 o.  Set the default location Scid looks for the spelling and ECO
     files (if the user has no options file) to /usr/local/share/scid/,
     since that is their default "make install" directory.

 p.  Fixed an annoying bug: if you navigated through a game when the
     comment editor was open, Scid would change the game status to
     altered even if you had not edited any comment or annotation.

 q.  Updated several help pages and added a footer to each help page
     indicating its last change, guessing 2.5 for any pages not
     updated for Scid 2.6.

 r.  New language translation supplied: Brazil Portuguese.

 s.  A few other small tweaks and bug fixes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.5: (June 2001)

 a.  New "Repertoire editor" feature, for managing your opening
     repertoire and using it to search databases.

 b.  Improved Scid to work better with engines that use the XBoard
     version 2 protocol. Scid now uses the engine's analyze mode for
     any engine that uses the new protocol and has an analyze command.

 c.  Analysis window: new "Add Move" button which adds the best-line
     move to the current game. Also new "Training" button which waits
     for the autoplay time delay each time the user makes a move, then
     makes the best-line analysis move -- effectively playing against
     the user with a fixed amount of time per move.

 d.  Improved the name spellchecker so it points out ambiguous
     corrections instead of arbitrarily choosing one of them.
     Each ambiguous correction is now shown in the spellcheck
     results window with "Ambiguous: " before the correction.

 e.  The spellchecker now also ignores the last five characters in a
     player name when they are the sequence " (ABC)" where ABC = any
     three uppercase letters. This means player names with country
     codes can still be spellchecked.

 f.  The rating difference (in Header search) is now White rating
     minus Black rating, not an unsigned (absolute) difference between
     the larger and smaller rating.

 g.  New configurable option in Opening Report, for setting the number
     of extra note moves (past the last column) in the theory table.

 h.  New "Knockout" mode in the Crosstable window, for better printing
     of knockout tournaments.

 i.  The Unix/Linux configure script now checks if your system already
     has the zlib library, and uses it (instead of compiling the version
     that comes with Scid) if possible.

 j.  The Game List window has a new "Save..." button for saving a
     text list of the current filter games (one line per game, in a
     fully configurable format) to a file.

 k.  Added more players and sites to spelling.ssp and ratings.ssp.
     They now have over 7000 players and over 500 sites.

 l.  The spellcheck file now has general prefix and suffix corrections,
     which are used to help standardize Event and Site names.

 m.  Scid can now read GZip-compressed spellcheck files, so you can
     keep ratings.ssp.gz compressed to save disk space.

 n.  New "Tablebase" window, which shows more tablebase details
     about the current position. It has a Training button for playing
     against a tablebase.

 o.  Scid can now have two analysis engines open at the same time.

 p.  A few minor bugfixes here and there...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.4: (May 2001)

 a.  New "Training" mode in the Tree window: turn it on and Scid plays
     against you each time you move, by selecting a random move from
     the tree (according to the relative frequency of each move).

 b.  Two new columns in the tree window: AvgElo and Performance. Each
     is only shown when the average rating or performance is based on
     10 or more ratings. Also added an AvYear column showing the mean
     year of each move played. These improvements required a change to
     the tree cache file format, so any old ".stc" files created from
     earlier Scid versions will be ignored.

 c.  Two new Game menu commands: Load first game and Load last game,
     for quick access to the first and last games in the filter.

 d.  Extended the Name Editor window to allow replacing the rating
     for a player (useful for setting a player rating for all games
     in the current tournament).

 e.  When exporting games, you can choose to export the games with or
     without comments and variations. Also, you can choose to create
     a new file or add games to an existing HTML, LaTeX or PGN file
     of games exported by Scid.

 f.  More multi-language support: deleting twins, name editor window,
     database compaction, sorting, etc.

 g.  I wrote a program for automatically converting all the Scid help
     pages in to HTML files. The HTML help files are available in the
     "help" subdirectory.

 h.  Expanded the scid.eco openings classification file. It now has
     over 8000 positions, and about 180 of the 500 basic ECO codes
     now have Scid extensions.

 i.  In the ECO Browser window, you can now click on a line to paste
     it in the "Import PGN Game" window.

 j.  Added "calendar" dialog box for selecting a date, available from
     the game save/replace window. This is only available with
     Tcl/Tk versions 8.3 or newer.

 k.  A few improvements to the Opening report: new subsections listing
     the most frequent players (as White and as Black) of the report
     line, and their score with the line. There is also a new column in
     the theory table: each row shows the number of games contained in
     all the row notes, and the percentage score of those games.
     Another improvement is a new "Options" command in the File menu
     for customising the report.

 l.  Increased the game limit for a Scid database from 3 million
     to 4 million games, at the request of a user who actually has
     a database that large.

 m.  New language supported: Czech. Fixed Scid so it should now work
     properly with languages that use the iso8859-2 character set (Czech
     and Polish), if appropriate fonts are being used.

 n.  New submenu in Edit menu: "Promote variation to Main line" which
     swaps a variation at the current position with its parent. Thanks
     to Manuel Hoelss for writing most of the code for this!

 o.  Each search window now reports search results via a status line at
     the bottom of the window, instead of showing an annoying message
     window after each search.

 p.  Most tall Scid windows are now shorter, making Scid more user
     friendly at low screen resolutions such as 800x600.

 q.  Header search can now search for a rating difference, for example
     for games where the players were within 100 points of each other.

 r.  Changed the score graph window, when showing scores for a game that
     has been annotated with crafty's "annotate" command, to expect the
     scores to always be from White's perspective which has been standard
     since version crafty 18.1. Earlier crafty versions had the scores
     from the perspective of the side to move.

 s.  New Tree window File menu commands: "Copy tree text to clipboard"
     which copies the tree window contents to the clipboard and primary
     X-selection, for pasting into another application such as a text
     editor. Also, "Fill cache file" which does a tree search for
     about 100 common opening positions and saves the tree cache file.

 t.  New maintenance window command: "Add Elo ratings", which uses a 
     modified version of the spellcheck file with rating history info
     for each player, and adds Elo ratings for players wherever the
     rating for each player at the date of each game is known.

 u.  Fixed a couple of memory leaks, and improved memory usage a little.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.3: (March 2001)

 a.  The compaction (of name and game files) and database sorting
     functions that were only available in the "scidt" command-line
     program, are now available in Scid itself (from the File:
     Maintenance menu or the Maintenance window). Even PGN files and
     read-only databases can be sorted, but the sort results are only
     permanent when sorting a regular (not read-only) Scid database.

 b.  Improved layout of Maintenance and Header search windows, making
     them wider but shorter which is better for users with low-res
     screens. Still need to reduce the height of the Delete Twins and
     Material Search windows...

 c.  Improved the speed of ECO classification, by about 40%.

 d.  Much more multi-language support: game information area, maintenance
     window, opening report, and the ECO Browser are all multi-language.

 e.  Some updates to help pages, mostly to reflect the changes to
     database compaction and sorting.

 f.  Ability to make an opened database read-only, to prevent accidental
     changes. To be writable again, it must be closed and re-opened.

 g.  Improved Help window: it now remembers what part of each page was
     visible, so when you go back to previous pages, the part you were
     viewing is displayed.

 h.  Improved usage of estimated ratings: they are now shown in the game
     list window, in parentheses. They are also used in header searches.
     They are not yet shown in the crosstable window, but may be in a
     future version.

 i.  Player name corrections improved: names that appear to be surnames
     only are now not corrected, unless the user requests that they are.
     This is useful since these corrections are often wrong.
     The spelling file is also larger, over 6000 players now.

 j.  When you "Save Options", the current widths of the game list
     columns are now saved to the options file.

 k.  Better handling of player names when converting from PGN: spaces
     at the start of a name are removed, and if a name ends " (xxxx)"
     where xxxx = four digits, that part is removed from the name and
     treated as an Elo rating, so for example:
         [White "Kramnik, V (2780)"]
     is imported as if it was:
         [White "Kramnik, V"]
         [WhiteElo "2780"]

 l.  Improved shortcut keys: many control key shortcuts (like Ctrl+L to
     open the game list, Ctrl+4 to switch to the clipbase, Ctrl+F to
     reset the filter, etc) are now available in almost all Scid windows.

 m.  Fixed a few small bugs from version 2.2.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.2: (January 2001)

 a.  Scid is now released under the Gnu General Public Licence (GPL).
     Previous versions had a more restrictive licence, but I now feel
     the GPL protects Scid enough and should encourage more people to
     use, contribute to, and distribute Scid without having to worry
     about yet another non-standard copyright licence.

 b.  Added support for showing help pages, menus and status bar messages
     in other languages.

 c.  Added new types of "current board" search. All require the same
     exact material and side to move as the current board, but you can
     search just by pawn structure, or by the files pawns are on. The pawn
     structure search is very useful for openings, while the pawn files
     search is good for finding similar endgames.

 d.  New "Opening Report" feature which produces interesting facts about
     an opening position and an ECO-style theory table.

 e.  The Board, Header and Material search windows are no longer modal,
     so you can have them all open at any time (and the Search button in
     each of them is disabled when you are not in an open database).

 f.  Scid now loads game number 1 whenever opening a database, rather than
     just showing the empty "game 0". Looks much nicer.

 g.  Scid can now read a FEN/EPD string on the command line, as one
     argument or as multiple arguments. For example, the following lines
     both open the database "base" with the French defence (1.e4 e6):
     scid base "rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq"
     scid base rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2

 h.  It is easy to open and use the Tree window, then close it but forget
     to save the cache file. Added a new Tree window Options menu entry to
     auto-save the cache file whenever the Tree window is closed.

 i.  Scid nows shows a progress bar when opening a database, which is
     helpful for large databases.

 j.  It was confusing that Tree searches ignored games marked for deletion,
     since they will still show up for positions found in the tree cache.
     The tree now shows all games that match, even deleted games.

 k.  Scid used to encode EventDate value (e.g. [EventDate "2001.10.16"])
     in 12 bytes, which was a waste since dates can be stored in a more
     compact format. Scid now uses just 4 bytes when an EventDate tag with
     a valid date is stored, saving 8 bytes per game. For my TWIC database
     (where most games have an EventDate) this prunes the game file by
     almost 10%.

 l.  Header search now also permits searching by Round name.

 m.  New "Goto move number" menu command, with shortcut Ctrl+U.

 n.  Scid now recognizes several rating types, not just Elo. The rating
     for each player in a game can now be one of 6 types: Elo (for FIDE
     ratings), Rating (for generic use), Rapid, ICCF, USCF, DWZ and BCF.
     More may be added in the future.

 o.  Scid can now read coordinate-style notation, e.g. "g1f3" or "g1-f3"
     for 1.Nf3, which was requested by users for two different purposes:
     to import games from websites that send moves in this notation instead
     of proper PGN format, and to accept keyboard move sequences generated
     by the DGT board.

 p.  Scid now estimates a rating for players with no rating in a game who
     do have a rating in at least one other game in the database. The
     estimate is the mean of the highest and lowest rating the player
     has in all other games in the database. Estimated ratings are
     indicated with a "*".

 q.  Fixed interference between move entry keys and menu shortcut keys.
     Before the fix, Alt + a letter key (such as Alt-f for the file menu)
     added "f" as if it was part of a move entered by the keyboard. Now,
     letters entered while an Alt key is pressed are not treated as
     keyboard move entry.

 r.  If there is only one variation at the current position, you can now
     enter it by just pressing "v" rather than "v1". If there is more than
     one, you still have to enter the number after the "v" of course.

 s.  Ran some programs over the FIDE October 2000 rating list, automatically
     adding new players and making corrections to the spellcheck file. It
     now contains over 5600 players.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.1: (November 2000)

 a.  New "ECO Browser" window that shows the positions used for each
     ECO code (if the ECO file is loaded), and shows the popularity and
     performance of each ECO code in the current database. Scid no
     longer uses an EPD file for ECO classification, it now reads the
     "scid.eco" file directly.

 b.  Scid can now use Nalimov-format endgame tablebase files! Whenever
     the current position is found in a tablebase file, Scid will show
     the result and optimal moves in the game information area.

 c.  Major overhaul of "delete duplicates" feature. It is now called
     "delete twins", and provides many options for adjusting the search
     for twin games. There is also a "twin checker" window which makes
     checking a deleted game against its twin easy.

 d.  Added key bindings ("v" followed by a number to enter a variation,
     "z" to leave) so variations can be browsed without using the mouse.
     Also improved the game information area so variations are listed,
     and you can click on them to navigate the game.

 e.  Made adding of variations more consistent. "Add Variation" used to add
     a variation replacing the last move, but this was inconsistent with
     all other variation operations which use the next (upcoming) move. Now,
     a variation of the next move is added, unless there is no next move
     (already at the end of the game or a line), in which case the variation
     is added to the previous move (the last move in the line).

 f.  Some improvements to the PGN window: new menus, and more consistent
     indentation when you select "Indent Comments" or "Indent Variations".

 g.  Several small interface improvements: remembering window sizes
     and saving them to the options file, etc. Also rearranged some menus,
     hopefully making them simpler.

 h.  Improvements to the player info window: now in color, and you can easily
     set the filter to contain all games by the player, or all wins, or all
     losses with Black, etc.

 i.  Simplified fonts, there are now just three basic fonts (named Regular,
     Small and Fixed) that Scid uses in all windows.

 j.  Added three more command-line scripts for Unix users of Scid:
     "sc_spell" which spellchecks a database, "sc_import" which
     imports files of PGN-format games into a database, and "sc_eco"
     which recomputes the ECO codes of all games in a database.

 k.  Added "-fast" or "-f" (or "/fast" or "/f" on Windows) command line
     option to Scid, which makes it start up faster without checking
     for tablebases, the ECO file or the spellcheck file. Also added
     "-xtb" option to avoid checking for tablebases, "-xeco" to avoid
     loading the ECO file, and "-xspell" to not load the spellheck file.
     Other options: "-s1", "-s2", ... "-s12" sets the initial board size.

 l.  The "splash screen" (Startup info window) now auto-closes itself after
     startup, at the user's preference.

 m.  Made the "results" section of Header searches aware of the "Ignore
     colors" setting, so, for example, searching for "Adams, Michael" as
     White, with "Ignore colors" selected and only "1-0" results will find
     all wins (as White or Black) by Michael Adams.

 n.  You can now use wildcard-style searches (? = 1 character, * = 0 or more
     characters) in Header searches, if you put the search text in double
     quotes, for example: "* GER".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 2.0: (October 2000 -- long delay but worth the wait I hope!)

 a.  New "Rating Chart" window, which graphs the rating history of
     one of both of the players in the current game.

 b.  New "Maintenance" window, to make manipulating the delete flags
     of games and spellchecking names easier.

 c.  Scid can now read GZip (.gz) files. You can open .pgn.gz files
     wherever you would open .pgn files, and .epd.gz files similarly.
     Gzip files are opened read-only and will not be modified.

 d.  You can now choose to display coordinates around the board. I find
     them very annoying, but I know the feature will help users who
     are new to chess notation.

 e.  The board now looks much nicer, since chess pieces now have
     outlines (in board sizes 5 and larger).

 f.  The tree window now has a "Graph" button for producing a graphical
     display of the relative results of moves from the current position.

 g.  A few small interface improvements, such as removing the annoying
     error box if you try to load the next game when you are already at
     the last game in the database.

 h.  Increased the game limit from 2 million to 3 million games in a
     database (yes, some Scid users really have a database that big!)

 i.  Scid now uses less memory for large databases. Although an
     index file uses 41 bytes per game, Scid was using 56 bytes per
     game to store the index in memory. It now uses 48 bytes per game
     instead, a saving of around 15%. This will help Scid run a bit faster
     for huge databases.

 j.  Improvements to exporting: the text printed at the start and end of
     the exported file (for example, <html> etc at the start of an HTML
     file) can now be edited from the Options menu, and is saved when
     you save options.

 k.  Added new key bindings: Control+Shift+ (left or right arrow) to
     change the board size.

 l.  Renamed the clipboard database to the "clipbase", to avoid confusion
     with the "clipboard" in Windows.

 m.  Spellcheck file improvements:
       - For player names, Scid can now detect surname-last format as well
           as surname-first, for surnames without spaces in them. Example:
           "G. Kasparov", will be now corrected to "Kasparov, Gary".
       - Merged the four files players.txt, events.txt, sites.txt, rounds.txt
           into one file (spelling.ssp) for simplicity.
       - Fixed small bug reading the spellcheck file, lines starting with
           a "%" (biography notes) were being mis-read as player names.
       - Expanded the players list in the spellcheck file. It now includes
           most players who have a rating over 2350, with over 5000 players.

 n.  You can now search in variations for exact board searches, but not
     for material/pattern searches yet.

 o.  Fixed a bug that was causing some games to be corrupted when compacting
     a large database after sorting it.

 p.  Added numeric locale option, for setting thousands and decimal point
     characters.

 q.  "Classify games" can now classify the games using basic ECO codes
     only, if you prefer them instead of the Scid extended codes.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.8: (July 2000)

 **  New options for the Crosstable window: can produce all-play-all table
     or a Swiss tournament table. Can also sort by score, name or rating.
     Also added option for plain text table, which is much faster for large
     tournaments.
     You can also save the crosstable to a file, in plain text or in
     HTML table format.

 **  New game export modes: Scid can now export the current game or all
     games in the filter to an HTML or LaTeX file, including printing
     diagrams wherever there is a diagram symbol or comment in the game.

 **  Improved, simpler main window menu arrangement with new "Windows" menu.

 **  Minor improvements to Player Information window.

 **  Tree window now skips deleted games, since they are usually duplicates
     and including them taints the statistics.

 **  Move entry: left mouse button still the same (use it to make suggested
     moves, or to drag between squares) but middle button changed; it now
     is used to select squares for two-click moving (instead of dragging).

 **  Some people prefer the notation "1. e4 e5" to "1.e4 e5". Now you can
     have a space after each move number, see the "Options: PGN Window"
     menu.  Thanks to Joel Rivat for this and other useful suggestions.

 **  Bugfix: When using tree window, squares on the board in the main window
     would sometimes be left colored gray (from earlier suggested moves)
     until the mouse moved over them. Now fixed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.7: (May 2000)

 **  First version of Scid for Windows produced.

 **  Scid can now spellcheck the player, event, site and round names in a
        database, and comes with four spellcheck files (players.txt,
        sites.txt, events.txt and rounds.txt) for this purpose.
        This makes the -E (name extension) option of scidt redundant, so
        it has been removed.

 **  New Player Information window: just click on a player name (in the
        game information box below the board, or in the crosstable
        window) to see information about the player: success rate,
        common openings played, and rating history.

 **  The Crosstable window now uses data from the Players spellcheck file
        if it has been loaded, showing the FIDE title (gm, im, etc) and
        most recent country for each player.

 **  The Game list window now has an entry box for entering a specific
        game number to display in the list, and an entry box for finding
        the next game that contains some text in its White, Black, Event
        or Site field.

 **  New "Hints" help page with tips in question-answer format.

 **  PGN importing: Scid can now also read compact algebraic notation
        captures with no rank, e.g. "ed" for exd5 and "ba=Q" for bxa8=Q.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.6: (March 2000)

 **  The Scid-specific book file format (.sbk) has been removed.
        Scid now reads and writes Book files in the standard EPD
        (Extended Position Description) format, for compatibility with
        other chess programs. The EPD format is described in the PGN
        Standard. Files in the old .sbk format cannot easily be converted
        to EPD since EPD files store more information.

 **  The standard Scid ECO file is now called scid.eco, not eco.txt, and
        "eco2book scid.eco" will create the file scid.epd for use in Scid.

 **  Tree window now displays an extra column for each open book file,
        which shows a summary of the text for the move displayed.

 **  Scid can now open a Book file from the command line, if it is
        specified with the .epd suffix, e.g.: "scid mybase mybook.epd"

 **  Scid can now import long algebraic notation, e.g. "1.d2-d4 Ng8-f6".

 **  The duplicate deletion feature now marks the shorter of two duplicate
        games as deleted, or the first in file order if they are have the
        same number of moves.

 **  Bugfix: when importing PGN games, Scid was not updating the name file,
        potentially leaving the database corrupted.
 **  Bugfix: scidt -E, -N and -C options were incorrectly resetting
        the index type icon back to the default blank icon; they now
        preserve the icon type.
 **  Bugfix: Defaults button in Header search was broken, now works.
 **  Bugfix: Paste game command in Edit menu was broken, now fixed.
 **  Bugfix: Scid with Tcl/Tk 8.3.0 was crashing when closing the tree
        window due to a bug in Tcl/Tk version 8.3.0 ONLY. Changed the
        code to avoid the Tcl/Tk bug, for those using 8.3.0.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.5: (March 2000)

 **  New Database switcher window. Provides easier switching between
        open databases, and copying all filtered games from one
        database to another using drag-and-drop.
        Each database has a "type" which is graphically shown in the
        switcher window; there are about 30 type icons to choose from.

 **  You can now open a PGN file directly in Scid, although PGN files use
        more memory, are much slower to load and are read-only so this
        is only recommended for small PGN files.

 **  Added Import games from PGN file command to the Tools menu. You
        can now import all games from a PGN file to any open database
        without needing to convert the PGN file with pgnscid first.

 **  In the board window, pressing and releasing the left mouse button on
        the same square now adds the suggested move for that square -- this
        means that to add any move other than the suggested move, you now
        need to drag between the two squares instead of clicking on each
        square in turn.

 **  Removed Export to clipboard and Import from clipboard commands
        from the Edit menu, because copying games between any two
        databases (not only to/from the clipboard) is now provided by
        the database switcher window (see above).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.4: (March 2000)

 **  New memory-only Clipboard database, for copying games between
        databases and for use as a temporary database. The clipboard
        can hold up to 10,000 games.

 **  Scidt -E can now take an optional player names text file that
        contains correct and alternate spellings for player names.
        A sample name file "names.txt" with over 3,000 player names is
        available at the Scid website.

 **  Improved analysis window setup a little, since the changes made
        in v1.3 were not working with Crafty on some computers.

 **  Crosstable window now displays average Elo rating and corresponding
        FIDE tournament category, and also shows the rating perfomance
        for each player that played five or more games in the tournament.
        It can also now handle up to 64 players in a tournament.
        Every second line is now shaded gray for easier reading.

 **  The game information box in the main window now has a popup menu
        for the right mouse button.

 **  Game list window right-mouse menu now includes commands to delete
        or undelete all games that are in the current filter.

 **  Header search now allows a restriction on the number of halfmoves
        in the game. This, combined with the "delete all filtered games"
        addition above, makes it easy to find and delete all games under
        a certain length.

 **  Scid now prints startup information to a splash window instead of
        standard output.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.3: (February 2000)

 **  Added duplicate game detection command, in the Files:Maintenance
        menu. (The Name editor command has also moved to that menu, it
        used to be in the Tools menu).
     Two games must have the same Event, Site, Date, Round, White and
        Black tags, and (mostly) the same moves to be duplicates.

 **  New Crosstable window. Shows the crosstable of all results from
        the tournament of the current game, for tournaments of up to
        32 players. You can click on any result in the crosstable to
        load the game it represents.

 **  New "Autoplay" button in the main window: automatically moves
        forward one move every second. Ctrl+RightArrow turns replaying
        on or off, Escape key turns it off. When you use autoplay mode
        while the analysis window is open, Scid annotates the game by
        adding the analysis for each move as a comment.

 **  Analysis window no longer uses crafty-specific commands unless it
        sees "Crafty" at the start of a line, so it should work with
        most xboard compatible chess programs -- even those that do
        not have an analyze mode. I have used Crafty, Gnuchess and
        Phalanx successfully with the analysis window in Scid 1.3.

 **  Changed the default startup light and dark square colors to shades
        of brown. If you have a "~/.scid" default file, you will have
        to delete it (or edit it and remove the "set lite" and "set dark"
        lines) to see the new colors.

 **  Added a frame-resizing bar to the Import window so the error
        messages frame can be made larger or smaller.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.2: (January 2000)

 **  Added Scid treecache file, for storing the contents of the
        tree cache to speed up tree searches for large databases.
        Very useful feature, wish I'd done this a long time ago!
     The button "Write Cache file" in the tree window saves the
        current cached tree results to a file with the database name
        and the suffix ".stc".
     A tree cache file is redundant, and is just removed when any
        database operation might leave it out of date -- e.g. saving
        a game, sorting the database, etc.

 **  Added PGN import feature (for a single game) to Scid.
        Now you can paste PGN-format game text (or just some moves in
        algebraic format without a PGN header) selected from another
        window and view the game in Scid, without having to save the
        text to a file and convert it to Scid format.
     This feature also doubles as a convenient way to make a few changes
        to the current game: just open the import window, click on
        "Paste current game", type the changes, and click "Import".

 **  Added ability to load a particular game number, with the
        shortcut key Control-G (for "game" or "goto").  The games list
        shortcut key has been changed to Control-L (for "list").

 **  Changed Header searches: player, event and site names entered
        for searches are now case-insensitive, and spaces are ignored.
        Example: "anand,v" will now match "Anand, Viswanathan".

 **  Comments at the start of a variation before any moves, example:
        1.e4 ({This comment} 1.d4 d5) 1...e5
        are now saved; in prior versions, they would not get saved.

 **  The game information below the board in the main window is now
        color-coded, making it is easier to read.

 **  Pgnscid now lets you specify a database name different to the
        PGN file name -- useful if you want the database to be created
        in a different directory from the PGN file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.1: (January 2000)

  -  Added "Book windows", support for editing Book files in Scid.

  -  Improved the Game List window a lot, it is now much nicer to use.
        It now has a proportional spaced font, color-coded columns,
        and each column can be resized.

  -  Rearranged the Tools menu, using submenus, to group related actions
        more logically.

  -  Improved error messages when Scid cannot open or create a database.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 1.0: (December 1999)

  -  Added the "Email manager", for sending correspondence chess emails.

  -  Improved the Scid PBook (now just called "Book") format.
        Classifying games by ECO code is now much faster -- probably
        about twice as fast.

  -  Added button bars to the Tree and Analysis windows. Added button
        in analysis window to paste the current evaluation score to the
        start of the current move's comment.

  -  Improved memory management for comments, fixed a memory leak.

  -  Fixed a very nasty bug: name files with a name that starts with an
        8-bit ASCII value (greater than 127) could not be opened.
  -  Fixed a bug that affected writing the name file after multiple
        changes with the name editor.
  -  Improved some error messages in scidt and pgnscid.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.5: (November 1999)

  Major features at a glance:
        sorting databases, saving search settings, opening read-only
        databases, name editor.

  -  Scidt now has a sorting option, to sort databases by many criteria.

  -  Added "Name editor" window, for editing all occurrences of a
        particular player, event, site or round name.

  -  More online help window pages, including a Quick Guide.

  -  Scid can now open a database where the index or game file is only
        readable (not writable) in read-only mode, and indicates this
        with "%%" in the status bar. Very useful for protecting a large
        database you only use for searches.

  -  Scid now asks the user before replacing a move that already exists in
        the game, but this can be turned off in the Options menu if the
        dialog box is annoying.

  -  The right-mouse button in the main window now deletes the last move,
        instead of just moving backwards.

  -  Material/Pattern searches: you can now specify a length of successive
        half-moves each game must match the search criteria for. Useful for
        eliminating games where the search criteria are only met for a
        move or two.

  -  Header and Material/Pattern searches can be saved to a SearchOptions
        file (suffix: ".sso") for later use, and used with the "Open"
        menu entry in the "Search" menu.

  -  Export of filter: can now be to a new Scid database (previously, only
        exporting to a PGN file was possible). Exporting to an existing
        Scid database is not implemented yet.

  -  User can now vertically resize the Game list window to alter the number
        of games shown, and the setting is saved when Options are saved.

  -  Improved key bindings, especially in Help window and Game List window.

  -  Changed "Control+Alt" shortcut keys to "Control+Shift".

  -  Pgnscid now accepts "~" as a symbol for the annotation "Unclear".

  -  Log file for warnings/errors generated by pgnscid now has the
        suffix ".err" instead of ".log".

  -  Bitmaps for buttons in main window of Scid, which look nicer.

  -  Some bug fixes:
        -  Fixed memory leak in copying of positions.
        -  Fixed rarely-occurring bug in reading positions from FEN strings.
        -  Removed "const char *" to "char *" assignments that are not
           accepted by new compilers, apparently.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.4: (September 1999)

  -  Too many to mention! Some of the more important changes:

  -  Hypertext-style online help within Scid.

  -  Status-bar tips for menus and buttons, describing their meaning.

  -  More options for scidt, the database maintenance utility.

  -  More search facilities, e.g. for games with/without comments,
     variations, etc.

  -  Most searches that involve decoding moves are a little faster.

  -  Keyboard move entry.

  -  More settable and saveable options.

  -  Nicer NAG (annotation) editing frame in the comment editor window.

  -  More shortcut keys.

  -  Several bug fixes; Scid should be far more stable with large
     databases now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.3:

  -  Added a font selector dialog box, so fonts can be changed without
        editing the start.tcl file.

  -  Added options for PGN display. Previously, display was always in color;
       that can now be turned on or off. User can now choose to indent
       comments, which is useful for heavily commented games.

  -  Coloring the PGN display is much faster than it was, although it is
       still a lot slower than plain display.

  -  Added saving of options (to the file .scid in the user's home
        directory). Saves board size, PGN display options and fonts.
        The options file is automatically loaded at startup if it exists.

  -  Added a Flip Board option, to have Black on the bottom and White on top.

  -  New search available: on current board. Previously, the only way to do
        this was to turn on tree mode.

  -  In tree mode, each move now also has its ECO code displayed if it is
        in the ECO book file.

  -  Added a Setup Start Board dialog box. Previously, Scid supported games
        with a non-standard starting position but there was no way to
        setup the initial board from within Scid itself.

  -  Clear game now prompts the user for confirmation if the game has been
        altered.

  -  There are now many more key shortcuts (e.g. Control + down-arrow to
        load the next game). Also, the game navigation keys (Home, End, and
        the arrow keys) now work the same in the PGN window as in the main
        window.

Version 0.2:

  -  First public release version.
