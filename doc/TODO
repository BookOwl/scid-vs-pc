 ===========================================================

- stop engine after last move in annotation (?)

- when FW on or network down, smoothen FICS connection

- add variations from analysis engine when the engine is locked

- Migrate optrainer to Mask

- Option to set engines as 1st and 2nd default engines

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- compile openseal for PocketPC

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- port FICS canvas to PPC

- FICS : user defined commands at login

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)

- Highlight exact position of errors in PGN import window

  (Annotator: Fritz    15. Bg5 ( {better } 15. Ng3) )
   Annotator: Crafty   15. Bg5 ( {with equality} )
   =>
   15. Bg5 ( {Fritz: better } 15. Bg3 )
           ( {Crafty: with equality} )

SEARCH MATERIAL
* fea: find symmetrical patterns (pawns a,b,c = f,g,h)
* fea: search by white/black/all piece count
* fea: find certain moves, specially captures (f. e. BxPe6 or RxNc3)
* fea: 'any white(black) piece' in patterns
* usa: Material Search window (use tabs)
