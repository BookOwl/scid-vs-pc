<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">installation </A></H2>


<P>
<H3>Linux , FreeBSD</H3>


<P>Scid vs. PC requires 
<A HREF="http://tcl.tk">Tcl/Tk</A> 8.5 or later.
<EM>Tcl/Tk 8.5.10 has nasty bugs and should be avoided.</EM></P>
Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk installed by default.
To verify this, look for a command named <B>wish</B> or <B>wish8.5</B>.
To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may need to install
<A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&amp;filename=tkimg1.3.scidvspc.tar.bz2">TkImg</A>.  Sound support requires 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scidvspc/files/support%20files/snack2.2.10.scidvspc.tgz/download">Snack</A>.
(Both of these downloads have fixes applied).
Then, installing from source:
<HR>
<PRE>
tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.11.tgz
cd scid_vs_pc-4.11
./configure
sudo make install
scid
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P><EM>It is also possible to install Scid vs. PC into <B>/usr</B>, instead of the normal <B>/usr/local</B>.
This allows for parallel installation with mainline Scid, and is done by: <B>./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/ SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/</B><BR><BR>
Scid's multi-language support can cause problems. Chinese (and other) users should use: <B>./configure LANGUAGES=""</B></EM></P>

<P>
<H3>Windows </H3>

<P>Windows installation simply requires downloading the 
<A HREF="#download_">executable</A>, and following the prompts.</P>
<P>The configuration files, <B>including the chess engine list</B>, are stored
in the <B>Scid-vs-PC\bin\config</B> directory, and may be copied over from
old versions to make upgrading easier. If the app is installed in "Program Files" On Windows 7, the config files are mirrored in
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Scid vs PC</P>
<P>People with Visual Studio 11 should now be able to compile the project fairly easily (see Makefile.vc for more details).</P>
<H3>Mac OS X </H3>


<P>The 
<A HREF="#download_">ScidvsMac-4.11 app</A> should include everything you need. Simply drag and drop the App into /Applications (or similar).</P>
<P><EM>Users upgrading may have to remove (or edit) <B>$HOME/.scidvspc/config/engines.dat</B>
to properly configure the chess engines.</EM></P>
<P>OS X  has a poor implementation of Tcl, and docked mode has minor bugs (some windows work better after being moved around, keyboard shortcuts are very hit and miss).</P>
<P>To compile from source - once you have XCode installed - please read <B>ScidvsMac-HowTo.rtfd</B> in the source tarball.</P>
<P><EM>OS X's Cocoa port of Wish is broken, with little chance of repair. Scid vs PC ships with a custom 32bit Carbon build of Wish.</EM></P>

<P>3.6.26.5 - New Gamelist widget, and re-fashioned main buttons. Project's looking quite solid :-> </P>
<P><B> June 23, 2009 </B></P>
<P>The monkey on my back has really been having a good time.  This release includes changes to the Gameinfo, Comment Editor, and Board Style widgets, some new chess pieces, colour schemes and tiles. Thanks to Michal and Alex for feedback.</P>
<P><B> June 4, 2009 </B></P>
<P>Well, the html is up, and i've got a couple of

<UL>
<LI> Openseal is an open source version of FICS Timeseal. It needs some
rewriting to work with Scid, though it is a small program.
</LI>
<LI> FICS could be adapted to work with the ICC. The work involves
analysing the differences in the strings used by the two programs.
(for example, for FICS  we have this line to ackowledge successful log-in
if {string match "*Starting FICS session*" $line]} {
The two servers do have many similarities i think, and examining
xboard's "backend.c" (or some other client) for "FICS" particularities
<LI> Russian translation is broken afaics, and has been removed for the time being.
<LI> The month i've updated the translations a little. (Thanks to Peter
for totally overhauling the Dutch one). The checklangs.tcl script is
in much better shape, but of course there are still lots of
translation "todos"
<LI> The TCL sound package, Snack, needs a maintainer.
<LI> There was a lot of work done to implement Fischer Chess (Chess 960),
but they never fixed all the bugs, and the web site
http://www.wtfai.me.uk/scid960.html is now gone. The latest code is in
ScidvsPC's source patches/chess960.patch
<LI> The Tree code works reasonably well, but i have never found the time
to overhaul the Slow/Fast/Slow modes. These were (for a long
time) negelected when Fulvio wrote the interuptible tree code. Scid
now has the Modes removed, so doing this in ScidvsPC probably wouldnt
be terribly hard to do.
<LI> There are two engine types - UCI and XBoard. Pascal's UCI code is in
some ways inferior to Shane's Xboard code.
Though this is mostly mitigated by the speed of modern processors,
it'd be nice to make use of the UCI ponder feature in analysis mode
(Comp mode already does so).
<LI> I've never had a chance to verify/update the Novag Citrine drivers
and interface due to lack of hardware.
<LI> Our Windows port needs a little overhaul to properly use Users home
directory to store all the various data.
I will get around to doing it one day though.
<LI> A lot of people use chessbase books (.ctg). Scid can only read
polyglot opening books, but inlining this projects
work may not be too hard.  https://github.com/sshivaji/ctgexporter</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7</A> <A HREF="#toc6.7">scid's history </A>
</H2>



<P>Scid is a huge project, with an interesting history. Originally authored by
Shane Hudson from New Zealand, it combined the power of Tk's GUI and
the speed of C, to produce a free Chess Database application with 
Opening Reports, Tree Analysis, and Tablebase support.
It gained quite some attention, as it was arguably the first project of it's
kind; but after writing over a hundred thousand lines of code, in 2004 development
stopped and Shane never contributed to Scid again.</P>
<P> Two new versions of Scid appeared around 2006. The first was ChessDB
authored by Dr. David Kirby. With some good documentation and 
the ability to automatically download games from
several web portals, it became popular. But at the same time Pascal Georges from France
was making strong technical improvements to Scid. Frustrated with Scid's dormancy,
and because of disagreements with ChessDB's author, Pascal released his own tree, Scid-pg, which 
included UCI support and numerous Player versus Computer features.</P>
<P> But subtley, and with some controversy, he began to adopt the name Scid as his own. Some
people objected, especially Dr. Kirby, with whom a flame war began, but 
Pascal's efforts to gain ownership of the Sourceforge Scid project eventually succeeded.</P>
<P>Under Pascal, and with the help of numerous contributors, Scid again strode
forward. Pascal wrote a Tree Mask feature, and in 2009
he upgraded the database format to si4, all the time making speed and technical improvements
to the neglect of the interface. In 2010, Pascal ceased contributing at all, and shortly after
the last stable version of Scid (4.3) was released.
Since then, Scid has had widespread, and unstable technical changes; mostly by Fulvio Benini,
who is a long-standing contributor.</P>
<P>Currently there exist several Scid related projects.</P>
<P>Chessx was originally by Michal Rudolf (a longtime Scid contributor from Germany) and named Newscid.  Now led by Jens Nissen, with a 1.0 release, it
is an attractive Chess GUI but with a small feature set and without si4 support.</P>
<P>Scid vs. PC was started in 2009 by Steven Atkinson from Australia. Forked from Scid-3.6.26, it began as an effort to tidy Shane's frenetic code base and improve the user interface, and has since matured into a capable Scid successor.</P>
<P>The Android app, Scid on the Go, supports the si4 database format, and is the only mobile Scid related project.</P>
<P>Another project nearing a 1.0 release is Scidb by Gregor Cramer from
Germany. It is ambitious chess database program inspired by Scid, with heavy
utilization of C++ classes and customized Tk widgets. It also supports
Chessbase databases and many chess variants.</P>
