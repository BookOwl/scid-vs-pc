General
-------

Toga II 1.3.4 based on Fruit is a UCI-only chess engine.  This distribution comes up only with
Windows executable and platform-independent source code.


This version performs at a similar level to 1.3.1 however its endgame is more accurate and it uses the EGBBs provided by Daniel Shawul (Scorpio)
- this version was previously know as 1.3x4b (with some setting tweaks see below).

The default settings for 1.3.4 have been adjusted following testing.

Toga Extended History Pruning has been turned off
and History Threshold has been adjusted to 70

For Blitz play Toga Extended History Pruning should be turned on and the History Threshold adjusted to 80
- these setting have shown to improve performance at blitz.

EGBBs
-----
    Toga uses the Scorpio endgame bitbases upto 5 pieces.
   
    Installation 
    ------------
       First You have to download the 5men bitbases from Leo Dijksman's WBEC site 
       http://www.wbec-ridderkerk.nl . The egbbs are 340mb in size. Then put them 
       anywhere in your computer. The default path is c:\egbb\ but you can change this in the uci options. 
       The egbbdll.dll must be in the same folder as the bitbase files.

Thanks Fabien Letouzey for the great source code of the program Fruit 2.1.

Special thanks to
Dieter Eberle, Karl-Heinz Söntges, Shaun Brewer for testing Beta Versions.
A big thank to Dieter Eberle for his setting.
Orlando Mouchel for bugfixes and new ideas.
Wilhelm Hudetz for the Logo.

Without their help i wouldn´t be able to increase the playing strenght, compared to Fruit 2.1, by about 100 Elo.
