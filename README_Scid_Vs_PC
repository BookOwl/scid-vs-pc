  1.  about


  Scid Vs PC <http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/> is a usability and bug-
  fix fork of Scid. With it you can play chess online or against the
  computer, browse tournaments downloaded in pgn format, and create huge
  chess databases

  Chess is a very technical thing. A single game can be analysed through
  and through, openings can fill volumes, and tournaments are full of
  statistics about winners, losers and openings played. Scid is a
  program whose original purpose was to combine all this information
  into databases of various sorts; hence it's name "Shane's Chess
  Information Database". As it turns out, computers are very good at
  playing  chess too.  This is the focus of Scid Vs PC.

  <https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&filename=scid_vs_pc-3.6.26.8.tgz>


  windows scid_vs_pc-windows-3.6.26.8.zip
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&filename=scid_vs_pc-
  windows-3.6.26.8.zip>

  browse files
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=263836> for
  the latest changes as patches.


  3.  installation


  Scid Vs PC requires Tcl/Tk-8.5 to be installed (though 8.4 will work
  in a pinch, and 8.6 is still in development).  Linux and FreeBSD
  should have Tcl/Tk <http://tkgames.sourceforge.net/index.html#ss1.2>
  installed by default.  To verify this, look for a command named wish
  or wish8.5.

  To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may
  need to install TkImg
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2>.


  3.0.1.  Linux , FreeBSD


  Recently i simplified the installation process a little:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-3.6.26.8.tgz
  cd scid_vs_pc-3.6.26.8
  configure
  make install
  scid
  ______________________________________________________________________


  The Play->Tactical Game feature should now work fine, without further
  configuration.


  3.0.2.  Windows

  First you must install Wish8.5. I recommend the excellent Active State
  Tcl <http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/>.  Then unzip
  ``Scid Vs PC'', browse to the bin directory and double click Scid.exe.


  3.0.3.  Mac OSX


  People have reported mixed success with OSX. Following the Linux
  installation instructions should work, but there are many different
  Tcl/Tk packages available for the Mac. I recommend trying
  <http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/>


  4.  how to play


  Two of Scid Vs PC's main features are Tactical Game, and playing
  online with Fics.

     Playing against the Computer
        The main Computer vs Player feature is accessed from
        Play->Tactical Game.  Here you'll find the option to start a new
        game (or Fischer Chess game), against a flexible computer
        opponent whose skill you can select.  Skill levels vary between
        1200 (a bright teenager with some experience), to 2200 (a
        National Master).


     Playing on the Internet
        Playing on the Internet is done via the the Play->Internet menu
        item. I recommend visiting the Fics <http://www.freechess.org>
        website to create a user account, but it is also possible to
        play anonymously. To start a game, press the Login as Guest
        button, then watch the available games as they are announced in
        the console. Enter play [game number] to accept a game
        challenge.


  There is more information about the Fics and Tactical Game features in
  the Scid help menus.


  5.  motivation


  Scid is an amazing project, but for several reasons I've decided to
  post my own hacks.


  o  The focus of Scid is Databases. Scid Vs PC is about improving the
     computer vs player experience.


  o  Many widgets are rough, ugly and poorly designed, and need
     refinement or rewriting.


  o  I have strong aversions to two recently added Scid features, both
     of which involve large scale code changes.


        The new ad-hoc windowing system  just doesn't cut it.  While
        Scid does have issues with window management, Tk just isn't
        sophisticated enough to make this new feature work. Even the
        Chessx project (which uses the amazing Qt-4 library) fairly
        struggles to fix this issue.


        Wish 8.5 includes a basic implementation of themes, and there
        has been widespread changes to Scid to use them.  Unfortunately,
        the changes are not justified for some dubious eye candy.


  o  Despite some work together, the current Scid project manager and I
     don't get on.
     Free software is like that ;->

  Working on the Fics widget and playing Blitz chess; it's been
  interesting, laugh. I'm fairly hopeless at Blitz! Anyway, major
  changes this release (3.6.26.8) include overhauling the material and
  FICs widgets, as well as some code to fix the recent files menu items.
  Lots of other stuff too.

   November 14, 2009

  I've discovered the great WatchBot
  <http://mekk.waw.pl/mk/watchbot/index> web page. It automatically
  records (some) Fics games, and allows for playback via your web
  browser. Here is a recent match between mukidi and stevenaaus.

   October 25, 2009

  This is just a maintenance release really, with a new Windows binary
  too :-) [3.6.26.7] FICs was kind-of broken, but have fixed it up. I
  had a good look at cleaning up some crappy code (the main board and
  material widgets are redrawn twice), but experienced issues, and have
  put it off for another day.

   August 16, 2009

  3.6.26.6 - Phalanx's illegal castling is no more. Changes to the Setup
  board and Toolbar configuration widgets, and heaps of other stuff.
  Whew!

  At the chess club... I'm not playing too badly. Mike plays a very
  solid, measured game, but maybe I've found his measure now. Gunnar
  still amazes me with his attacking chess though. Last week he was back
  after a two week hospital stay, but still managed a fairly effortless
  simultaneous against Mike and myself.

   July 17, 2009

  3.6.26.5 - Great new Gamelist and Game Info widgets. Quite a few
  correctness features , and redid the main buttons... Project's looking
  quite solid :->

   June 23, 2009

  A new release today :-> I've had some holidays, and the monkey on my
  back has really been having a good time.

  Widgets getting major updates are: Gameinfo, Comment Editor, and the
  Board Style widget. There's also some great new chess pieces
  (requiring Tkimg), colour schemes, and tiles. Thanks to Michal and
  Alex for feedback.

   June 4, 2009

  Well, the html is up, and i've hopefully got a couple of files in the
  downloads section. My project is fairly modest ... just rewriting Tk
  widgets when i get the urge.  Unfortunately i have no plans to
  maintain Scid Vs PC against the mainstream Scid project, but anyone is
  welcome to do so.

  I love this project, so check out my changes and please contact me if
  you have requests, or know of important changes to Scid that i should
  incorporate.
