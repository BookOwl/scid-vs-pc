  1.  introduction


  Scid vs PC <http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/> is a usability and bug-
  fix fork of Scid (written by Shane Hudson and Pascal Georges). With it
  you can play chess online or against the computer, browse tournaments
  downloaded in pgn format, and create huge chess databases.

  Chess is a very technical thing. A single game can be analysed through
  and through, openings can fill volumes, and tournaments are full of
  statistics about winners, losers and openings played. Scid is a
  program whose original purpose was to combine all this information
  into databases of various sorts; hence it's name "Shane's Chess
  Information Database".

  Scid vs PC is more of a consumer chess program than Scid. It's meant
  for people who want to play chess with an attractive interface,
  without having to understand the complex database capabilities of
  Scid.

  2.  features


  Improvements over Scid:


  o  A Computer Tournament feature.

  o  The Gamelist widget (which now handles large DBs) looks and works
     much better. Deleted items are greyed out, and there's a "Compact"
     button.

  o  Improved Tactical Game program.

  o  A redone Button Bar with a nicer look and feel.

  o  The Fics interface is fairly different, with a nice accept/decline
     widget for multiple offers.

  o  The Chessboard/Pieces config widget has been totally overhauled.
     There are some nice colour and tile theme, and great piece set
     available if the optional TkImg package is installed.

  o  The Setup Start Board has many fixes and improvements.  Annoyingly,
     if Scid uses a tiled theme, it's setup board is displayed a
     different colour.

  o  The main board has a handy right-click menu, and the side-to-move
     indicator is now on the left.

  o  The Help index is now meaningful to new users, with links to the
     game's main features.

  o  The Comment editor has been overhauled, and is much more stream-
     lined.

  o  Restructured workings of the Analysis Engines widget. The F2 and F3
     key bindings can now be set explicitly.

  o  The over ambitious adhoc Windowing System, and Theme features of
     Scid are not included.

  See ``changes'' for a comprehensive changelog.

  browse files
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=263836> for
  the latest changes as patches.


  4.  installation


  Scid vs PC requires Tcl/Tk
  <http://tkgames.sourceforge.net/index.html#ss1.2> 8.5

  Tcl 8.4 will work with a few errors, and 8.6 is still in development.


  4.0.1.  Linux , FreeBSD


  Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk installed by default.  To verify this,
  look for a command named wish or wish8.5.  To enable support for extra
  chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may need to install TkImg
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2>.
  Then, installing from source:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.0.tgz
  cd scid_vs_pc-4.0
  configure
  make install
  scid
  ______________________________________________________________________


  It is also possible to install Scid vs PC into /usr, instead of the
  normal /usr/local.  This allows for parallel installation with
  mainline Scid, and is done by:
  ./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/ SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/


  4.0.2.  Windows

  First you must install Wish8.5. I recommend the excellent Active State
  Tcl <http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/>.  Then unzip
  ``Scid vs PC'', browse to the bin directory and double click Scid.exe.


  4.0.3.  Mac OSX


  There's now an App package for Scid vs PC in the ``downloads''
  section.  Of course you'll have to install Tcl/Tk first... There are
  many different Tcl/Tk packages available for the Mac. I recommend
  trying  <http://www.categorifiedcoder.info/tcltk/>

  Compiling from source, people have reported mixed success. Once you
  have the developer tools installed from your OSX disk, following the
  Linux installation instructions should work.


  5.  how to play


     Playing against the Computer
        The main Computer vs Player feature is accessed from
        Play->Tactical Game.  Here you'll find the option to start a new
        game (or Fischer Chess game), against a flexible computer
        opponent whose skill you can select.  Skill levels vary between
        1200 (a bright teenager with some experience), to 2200 (a
        National Master).


     Playing on the Internet
        Playing on the Internet is done via the the Play->Internet menu
        item. I recommend visiting the Fics <http://www.freechess.org>
        website to create a user account, but it is also possible to
        play anonymously. To start a game, press the Login as Guest
        button, then watch the available games as they are announced in
        the console. Enter play [game number] to accept a game
        challenge.


  There is more information about the Fics and Tactical Game features in
  the Scid Help menus.


  6.  news


   July 3, 2010

  New release coming up. It's my tenth, but have gone with verison
  number 4.0 instead of 3.6.26.10.

  It's pretty big too :).

  The Computer Tournament feature runs great ... now.  Initially i had a
  poor control mechanism, but thanks to some UCI snippets from Fulvio, i
  got inspiration to rewrite it properly, and every thing seems fine
  except for  some  smaller engines poor handling of time slices.
  RobboLito is the best Linux engine i tested. Stockfish is very close,
  and Gnu Chess 5.0 can hold it's head up, managing to beat Crafty once.

  The other main feature is a zippy Gamelist widget - allowing for huge
  databases to be rendered in seconds rather than minutes. Also, deleted
  items are now greyed-out, and there's a new "Compact" button.

   April 19, 2010

  I've made so many changes recently, i think they deserve a release :>.
  Best stuff is:

  o  The new Fics accept/decline offers widget, which is a bit of a
     necessity imho

  o  Some work with the crosstable and player info widgets (which is
     only evident with the inclusion of spelling.ssp)

  o  and some work with font configuration, including a more streamlined
     start-up procedure.

   December 20, 2009

  Finalised 3.6.26.8 ;> Just lots of help menu nice-ities i've added at
  the last minute.
  Thanks to Dorothy for making me a Mac DMG package.

   December 04, 2009

  Working on the Fics widget and playing Blitz chess; it's been
  interesting, laugh. I'm fairly hopeless at Blitz! Anyway, major
  changes this release (3.6.26.8) include overhauling the material and
  FICs widgets, new help menus, as well as some code to fix the recent
  files menu items. Lots of other stuff too.

   November 14, 2009

  I've discovered the great WatchBot
  <http://mekk.waw.pl/mk/watchbot/index> web page. It automatically
  records (some) Fics games, and allows for playback via your web
  browser. Here is a recent match between mukidi and stevenaaus.

   October 25, 2009

  This is just a maintenance release really, with a new Windows binary
  too :-) [3.6.26.7] FICs was kind-of broken, but have fixed it up. I
  had a good look at cleaning up some crappy code (the main board and
  material widgets are redrawn twice), but experienced issues, and have
  put it off for another day.

   August 16, 2009

  3.6.26.6 - Phalanx's illegal castling is no more. Changes to the Setup
  board and Toolbar configuration widgets, and heaps of other stuff.
  Whew!

  At the chess club... I'm not playing too badly. Mike plays a very
  solid, measured game, but maybe I've found his measure now. Gunnar
  still amazes me with his attacking chess though. Last week he was back
  after a two week hospital stay, but still managed a fairly effortless
  simultaneous against Mike and myself.

   July 17, 2009

  3.6.26.5 - Great new Gamelist and Game Info widgets. Quite a few
  correctness features , and redid the main buttons... Project's looking
  quite solid :->

   June 23, 2009

  A new release today :-> I've had some holidays, and the monkey on my
  back has really been having a good time.

  Widgets getting major updates are: Gameinfo, Comment Editor, and the
  Board Style widget. There's also some great new chess pieces
  (requiring Tkimg), colour schemes, and tiles. Thanks to Michal and
  Alex for feedback.

   June 4, 2009

  Well, the html is up, and i've hopefully got a couple of files in the
  downloads section. My project is fairly modest ... just rewriting Tk
  widgets when i get the urge.  Unfortunately i have no plans to
  maintain Scid vs PC against the mainstream Scid project, but anyone is
  welcome to do so.

  I love this project, so check out my changes and please contact me if
  you have requests, or know of important changes to Scid that i should
  incorporate.


  7.  bugs


  o  Windows only:

     o  The Phalanx windows binary still has the castling bug. (Anyone
        compile me a new version?)
     o  Using "ALT+F"... etc key bindings to access the menus is badly
        broke. This is a Tcl/Tk issue.

     o  Window focus/raise issues, another Tcl/Tk issue.

  o  There is no drag-and-drop file opening.

  o  Not really a bug, but Scid vs. PC doesn't support the new .si4
     database format of mainline Scid.

  o  In some uncommon circumstances, moving board pieces won't work
     perfectly.
