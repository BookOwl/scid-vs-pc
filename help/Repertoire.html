<h1>The Repertoire editor window</h1>
<p>
The Repertoire editor lets you create, view, edit and <b><i><font color="#990000">repertoire</font></i></b>
files. A repertoire (.sor) file is a list of the opening positions you want to
reach or try to avoid, and you can use it to manage your chess opening
preferences and also to search databases in Scid.
</p>

<h3>Repertoire groups and lines</h3>
<p>
A repertoire contains two types of elements: <b><i><font color="#990000">groups</font></i></b> and
<b><i><font color="#990000">lines</font></i></b>. Groups are not actually part of your repertoire; they
are only used to structure it the same way directories give structure to the
files on a computer disk.
</p>
<p>
Lines in a repertoire come in two types: <b><i><font color="#990000">include</font></i></b> lines which
represent opening positions you are interested in and try to reach,
and <b><i><font color="#990000">exclude</font></i></b> lines which are those you have no interest in
playing and try to avoid.
For example, if you play the QGA (1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4) as Black and you play
all moves after 3.e4 <i>except</i> 3...Nf6, you would have
1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 as an include line and 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 Nf6 as
an exclude line.
</p>

<h3>Comments and notes</h3>
<p>
Each group or line can have comments attached to it. There are two types:
short (single-line) comments appear (in red) in the repertoire hierarchy
next to the moves of a group or line, while a long (multiple-line) comment
is only shown when the group or line is selected.
</p>

<h3>Using the repertoire editor window</h3>
<p>
The <b>left</b> side of the window shows the repertoire hierarchy. You can
click on folder icons to expand and collapse groups, and click on the
moves of a group or line to select it and see its comments.
Include lines are shown with a blue tick icon, and exclude lines have
a red cross.
</p>
<p>
If a line or group has a short comment, it is shown after the moves. If it
has a long comment, this is indicated with <b><font color="red">**</font></b> after the
moves. Groups have a number in parentheses after their moves showing the
number of (include and exclude) lines they contain.
</p>
<p>
Clicking the right mouse button on a group or line produces a menu
of functions for it, such as deleting it or changing its state.
</p>
<p>
The <b>right</b> side of the window contains three frames. The first frame
is a list of the moves in the currently selected line or group. You can click
the left mouse button on this to paste the moves in the
<a href="Import.html">Import</a> window, which is useful for setting the current game
to start with a line in the repertoire.
The second frame contains the short comment for the line or group, and
the third frame contains its long comment.
</p>

<h3>Adding groups and lines to the repertoire</h3>
<p>
To add a line or group to the window, just make its moves on the
chessboard in the main window, then use the <b><font color="#007000">[Edit]</font></b> menu
in the repertoire editor to add it as a group, include line or exclude line.
</p>
<p>
To delete a group or line, click the right mouse button on it and select
the appropriate command from the menu that appears.
</p>

<h3><a name="Search">Searching databases using repertoire files</a></h3>
<p>
The repertoire editor <b><font color="#007000">[Search]</font></b> menu lets you search the
current database using the repertoire. Each game will be searched for
the positions in the repertoire and will only match the search if
the <i>deepest</i> repertoire position found is for an <i>include</i> line.
</p>
<p>
You can choose to search using the whole repertoire, or just the displayed
lines. Searching by displayed lines only is useful when you only want to
use some of the repertoire. For example, a repertoire might have two main
groups at the top level, one for 1.e4 and one for 1.d4. If you are only
interested in the 1.e4 lines, simply collapse the 1.d4 group and then
search by displayed lines only.
</p>

<h3>Extra hints</h3>
<p>
A repertoire file is great for finding new games in your opening systems.
For example, each time you get a new PGN file to add to your main database
(such as the excellent weekly PGN file from
<a href="http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/">The Week In Chess</a>),
just open the PGN file in Scid and do a repertoire search. Then you
can browse the filtered games to see all the games played that are
in your repertoire.
</p>
<p>
You may want to keep two repertoire files: one for Black and one for
White, so you can search with each file separately.
</p>
<p>
A repertoire file can be opened from the command line, for example: <br>
<b>scid mybase white.sor</b>
</p>
<p>
You can edit a repertoire (.sor) file in any text editor, but be careful
to preserve its format or it may not be loadable or searchable in Scid.
