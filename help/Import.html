<h1>The Import window</h1>
<p>
Scids Import window provides an easy way for you to paste a game
in <a href="PGN.html">PGN format</a> into Scid from some other application or window.
</p>
<p>
The large white frame in the window is where you type or paste
the text of the game in PGN format, and the gray frame below it
provides feedback of any errors or warnings.
</p>

<h3>Editing the current game with the Import window</h3>
<p>
The Import window also doubles as a convenient way to make a few changes
to the current game: you can paste the current game into the
Import window (with the <b>Paste current game</b> button), edit the
text, and click <b>Import</b> when done.
</p>

<h3>PGN tags in the Import window</h3>
<p>
Scid expects to see PGN header tags such as
<ul>
<li> <b>[Result "*"]</b> </li>
</ul>
before any moves, but you can just paste in a game fragment like
<ul>
<li> <b>1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Bc5 3.Qh5?! Nf6?? 4.Qxf7# 1-0</b> </li>
</ul>
without any header tags and Scid will import it.
</p>

<h3>Using PGN files in Scid</h3>
<p>
If you want to use a PGN format file in Scid but do not
want to convert it with <a href="Pgnscid.html">pgnscid</a> first, there are two
possible ways.
</p>
<p>
First, you can import the games in the file to an existing database
with the <b><font color="#007000">[Tools: Import file of PGN games...]</font></b> menu command.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is to open the PGN file directly in Scid. However, PGN
format files are opened read-only and consume more memory than a
comparable Scid database, so this is only recommended for relatively
small PGN files.
