<h1>Correspondence Chess</h1>

To use the correspondence chess features described here a database of
the type "Correspondence" has to be opend before calling any menu
items or buttons. Otherwise scid will issue an error message
complaining that none is open. However, do not open more than one
database fo this type as scid then can not recognise the one to use.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Correspondence Chess within scid is based upon a normal scid
database that holds the games and some helpers external to scid that
handle the "non-chess-parts". To access the configuration dialog
choose <b><font color="#007000">[Play / Correspondence Chess /
Configure]</font></b> from the menue. A dialog will open presenting
the follwoing choices:
<ul>
   <li><i>Default Database</i>: From the 
   <b><font color="#007000">Correspondence Chess</font></b> menue one
   can choose <b><font color="#007000">Open Database</font></b>. The
   database opend is set in this entry. The advantage of this method
   is, that this database does not show up in the <i>recent
      databases</i> lists.
   </li>
   <li><i>Inbox (path)</i>: In this directory scid will look for PGN
   files containing the games that are used to synchronise the
   correspondence chess database. Generally, scid does not care how
   the games come to this directory. It will just work through all PGN
   files located there. This offers the possibility to use some
   external tools to fetch games to this location. Additionally, in
   eMail chess one should just save the PGN files received from the
   opponent into this directory.
   <p>Scid will not read a mailbox of whatever sort, it just handles
   all PGN files placed in that directory. Also note, that it will
   synchronise games with the current database. However, if a game
   from this directory does not yet exist in the database it is
   treated as new game and appended to the database.
   </p>
   </li>
   <li><i>Outbox (path)</i>: The inverse of the <i>Inbox</i>. Scid
   places here PGN files of the outgoing games. For eMail chess this
   essential as the PGN files have to be attached to an eMail message.
   For Xfcc, where only the move is sent, this would not be necessary,
   however the Outbox directory offers a convenient way to link up to
   your PDA or for any other usage.
   </li>
   <li><i>Fetch Tool</i>: This program is called to automatically
   retrieve correspondence chess games. This helper just has to fetch
   the games from whatever source it likes, generate a proper PGN file
   containing the necessary PGN header. Tools for fetching games from
   Xfcc-servers exist as external programs and these are the natural
   tools to set up here. For future protocols one could easily
   generate an external fetch tool that handles this protocol. Also
   automatisation is possible if this functionality is done
   externally.
   <p>
   Note: This tool is <b>not</b> called for eMail chess!
   </p>
   </li>
   <li><i>Send Tool</i>: This is the inverse of the fetch tool,
   primarily also ment for Xfcc support or any future protocol that
   might come up. The send tool, however, is called from scid with
   several parameters:
   <pre>
   SendTool Outbox Name GameID MoveCount Move "Comment" resign claimDraw offerDraw acceptDraw
   </pre>
   The meaning of the parameters is as follows:
   <ul>
      <li>Outbox: The path set in this dialog. The send tool is meant
      to generate a correctly formatted PGN file there.
      </li>
      <li>Name: The name of the player to move as stated in the
      PGN header. For Xfcc this would be the login name.
      </li>
      <li>MoveCount: The move number to send.
      </li>
      <li>Move: The actual move in SAN
      </li>
      <li>"Comment": A comment sent to the opponent. Scid inserts here
      comments that are placed after the last move. That is these
      comments are treated as comments to the opponent. Note that the
      comment is quoted, so multiline comments should be possible.
      </li>
      <li>resign: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user wants to
      resign.
      </li>
      <li>claimDraw: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user wants to
      claim a draw.
      </li>
      <li>offerDraw: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user wants to
      offer a draw.
      </li>
      <li>acceptDraw: 0 or 1, specifying wether the user wants to
      accept a draw offered by the opponent.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   Note: This tool is <b>not</b> called for eMail chess!
   </p>
   </li>
   <li><i>Mail program</i>: give the path to your prefered eMail
   program. This program is called for eMail chess.
   </li>
   <li><i>(B)CC Address</i>: A copy of the outgoing message is sent to
   this address as blind copy. Note however, that if a GUI mailer is
   used it has normally its own outgoing mail handling. Hence, setting
   this address might duplicate messages. It can be used to transfer a
   game to another address though.
   </li>
   <li><i>Mode</i>: Unfortunatley there exists a wide range of mail
   clients and they use very different calling conventions. Some
   common conventiones, and examples of programs that use them, are
   listed here. The mailprogram will be called with the convention
   selected here. In case it is not known which convention is used one
   of those offered might match and do the trick.
   <p>Hint 1: mailx or one of its many clones should be available as a
   command line application on almost any platform as an easy to set
   up version. In case none of the conventions work with your
   preferred client or this client can not handle mails with
   attachements by calls from the command line, installing mailx would
   be an option.
   </p>
   <p>Hint 2: mutt uses the systems mail transport (aka
   sendmail/exim/postfix). To hook up with those (arguably) not easily
   to set up tools mutt is a perfect option.
   </p>
   </li>
   <li><i>Attachement parameter</i>: This parameter is used to specify
   an attachement. It is <b>only</b> used in mailx mode.
   </li>
   <li><i>Subject parameter</i>: This parameter is used to specify the
   subject of the mail message. It is <b>only</b> used in mailx mode.
   </li>
</ul>

<h3>Stepping through games</h3>
<p>
After games are retrieved they are loaded to scids clipboard database.
By the two arrow icons in the button bar one can step through all
games in the Inbox easily in either direction. This is not dependent
wether the games are eMail games or use another protocol like Xfcc.
Alternatively one can select <b><font color="#007000">Next
Game</font></b> or <b><font color="#007000">Previous Game</font></b>
form the menue.
</p>
<p>
Note that if you set up your player names correctly scid will rotate
the board for your to play always upwards. You can have multiple
player names.
</p>

<h3>eMail Chess</h3>
<p>
Scid can handle eMail correspondence chess games almost automatically.
The way how this is done is kept compatible to the cmail utility that
comes with xboard on Un*x systems. (Having said this implies that you
can play against an opponent using cmail/xboard.) It works by sending
the games as whole PGN files too and fro while the header contains
certain tags that allows them to be recognised and sorted together.
For this reason the user has to be carefull with editing the header
fields.  Note that fields with explicit values have to be set to
exactly this value for eMail chess. Starting a game with scid will do
this automatically, but you <b>must not</b> overwrite them!
</p>
<p>
Essential header fields are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><i>Event</i>: "Email correspondence game"
   </li>
   <li><i>Site</i>: "NET"
   </li>
   <li><i>Mode</i>: "EM"
   </li>
   <li><i>WhiteNA</i>: contains the eMail address of the white player. Note
   that only the bare address is stored there in the form
   <i>user@host.org</i>.
   </li>
   <li><i>BlackNA</i>: contains the eMail address of the black player similar
   to WhiteNA.
   </li>
   <li><i>CmailGameName</i>: Contains a <b>unique</b> identifier for the
   game.
   <p>
   While scid could use some database index this is not possible
   for non-DB-based tools. For this reason this parameter is user
   suppied. It must be unique! The easiest way is something of the
   form xx-yy-yyyymmdd where xx is a shortcut for the white player, yy
   one for the black player, and yyyymmdd the current date.
   </p>
   <p>For Xfcc-based games this field has also to be set to a unique
   identifier but there the server name and the unique game number on
   the server ist used, that is this identifier is of the form
   <i>MyXfccServer-12345</i>.
   </p>
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>Start a new game</h4>
<p>
This opens a dialog for the input of the own and the opponents name as
they should appear in the header as well as the eMail addresses of
both parties. Additionally a <b>unique</b> game ID has to be inserted.
The easiest way for this ID is something of the form xx-yy-yyyymmdd
where xx is a shortcut for the white player, yy one for the black
player, and yyyymmdd the current date. This id is a text and it is
important to identify the games uniquely. Users of cmail will also
know this ID as <i>game name</i>.
</p>
<p>
After the dialog is quit by pressing the <b>[Ok]</b> button a new
game is appended to the currently loaded correspondence chess database
and the headers are set properly. Just make your move and send it.
</p>

<h4>Retrieve games</h4>

<p>
scid does not handle your mailbox automatically as this would,
considering the wide range of possible mail setups these days, involve
a huge ammount of code. For this reason just use your normal mail
program that will retrieve your eMail anyway. To get a game into scid
just save the attached PGN file to scid's inbox and process the inbox
by either <b><font color="#007000">Retrieve Games</font></b> (the same
is accomplished by the left small envelope with an arrow pointing down
in the button bar) or <b><font color="#007000">Process
Inbox</font></b>.  The difference between the two is that the
first one will also call the external fetch tool and populate the
Inbox also with games from another source (say Xfcc).
</p>


<h4>Send the response</h4>

<p>
After making your move send it by either the <b><font
color="#007000">Mail Move</font></b> item from the menue or the
right envelope icon with a small arrow pointing upwards. The latter
will scid have to recognise the game as eMail correspondence and send
it by mail.
</p>
<p>
Of course scid strips the the game bare of any comments and variatoins
before sending it to the opponent. If a GUI-mailer is used, the usual
compose window is opend. It is prefilled with a properly attached PGN
file from scids Outbox. The address of your opponent is filled in as
well as a generic subject containing the game id for easy filtering
and the bcc address if specified. The mail body is set to contain the
FEN of the final position and a list of moves that lead to this
position. This way the opponent can quickly look up your move without
processing the attachement. Of course the mail body can be edited.
</p>
<p>
When using mailx compatible tools no window is opened and the mail is
sent invisibly by invoking the tool specified in the background. In
this case the generated mail contains the PGN also in the mail body.
</p>
<p>
Note that as eMail chess works by sending the whole PGN file you must
not add more than your half move. Scid does not checking here wether
more then one hlaf move was added to the mainline, simply as scid does
not know which move it is, when you send yours.
</p>

<h3>Xfcc Servers</h3>

<h4>Start a new game</h4>
<p>
Xfcc does not allow to start a new game itself. Searching for an
opponent and starting a game is instead handled by the Xfcc chess
server via login on their web site. Once the game is started however,
scid can be used to retrieve the moves of the opponent, add them to
the internal database, analyse and so on. All features of scid are to
the users disposal though certain modes of play may not allow them
(e.g. normal games usually do not permit the usage of chess engines
for analysis).
</p>

<h4>Retrieve games</h4>
<p>
Open a database that holds correspondence chess games. This database
has to be of type "Correspondence Chess". 
</p>

Notes: 
<ul>
   <li>If scid does not find a correspondence chess database it will
   silently quit and do nothing
   </li>
   <li>If the database does not hold the games that are fetchted from
   the server they are treated as new games and added to the database
   </li>
   <li>scid will use the first database of type "Correspondence Chess"
   that is currently open. For this reason only one such DB should be
   opened at a time.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
Xfcc always retrieves all games hosted on a specified server at once.
To retrieve the games just press the "retrieve games" icon or select
<b><font color="#007000">Retrieve Games</font></b> from the <b><font
color="#007000">[Correspondence Chess]</font></b> menue. As a
server connection is required to fetch new games be sure that the
system has network access. Additionally it may take some time to
retrieve the answer.
</p>
<p>Note that the Fetch tool is called without any parameter. It is
thought to work through all your Xfcc-accounts and place properly
formatted PGN files in scids inbox.
</p>
<p>
Once the games are retrieved their counterpart is searched within the
Correspondence Chess DB and new moves are added accordingly. As Xfcc
servers may offer various ways to insert moves it might well be that
scid will have to add half of the game to the DB. This poses no
problem. scid will just add all moves till the current position is
reached.
</p>
<p>
Note that if other sources have placed games in your inbox (e.g. from
your eMail correspondence chess) they are also synchronised in this
step into the database. Games that are not yet found in the database
are treated as new games and appended to the database.
</p>

<h4>Analyse and make a move</h4>
<p>
All analysis features can be used for Xfcc games. Adding variations,
annotations etc. can be added just like in normal game analysis. Once
finished scid will take the last half move added to the game and
treat it as the current move to send. No checking wether only half a
move was made or which side to move is done here, hence, only one half
move to the mainline must be added! Additionally scid sends the last
comment added to the game to the server as a message for the opponent.
