* mega2006.xml.gz       : meta data for player photos delivered with
                          Mega 2006 as a simple XML structure
                          associating the player name with the proper
                          image file.
* failed-mega2006.xml.gz: meta data for files that might be available
                          on newer Mega DB's. Could be merged with 
                          mega2006.xml.gz
* Mega2Scid.pl          : very simple perl-hack using ImageMagick and
                          mpack to convert the original JPG images to 
                          GIF files while scaling them down
                          appropriately. After conversion they are
                          recoded to base64 for usage with scid and a
                          proper spf-file is generated.

                          This script was tested on Linux only, but
                          should also give a general idea how to
                          proceed on another OS.
