revision 1.10
date: 2002/03/24 15:51:19;  author: oakden;  state: Exp;  lines: +175 -11
Modified Shane's fullname function to add extensions to absolute pathnames
too.

Added status window, and an option to turn it off.

Tweaked smallTime parameter again (400ms).

Added usage message if called with no arguments.
----------------------------
revision 1.9
date: 2002/03/23 07:55:08;  author: oakden;  state: Exp;  lines: +50 -8
Added isBusy checking before [send]ing any switchBase command.  Any
interpreters found busy are added to a deferredSwitch array which is
processed at the end with timeouts/retries as is done when opening
bases.

The smallTime parameter was changed to 300ms to make for a maximum wait
of approx 3 seconds for a Scid to become un-busy.

Changed default for debugging to 0 (as I was doing manually for release)
----------------------------
revision 1.8
date: 2002/03/23 07:10:21;  author: oakden;  state: Exp;  lines: +40 -24
Merged changes from Shane Hudson:-

"I've tweaked a few comments (adding a reference to the Scid website and
 changing SCID to Scid, which is how I spell it even though the name
 originated as an ancronym), and also added code to the fullname proc
 adding a suffix, so typing "sc_remote mybase" will look for mybase.si3,
 or mybase.pgn, etc, adding the first Scid-recognised suffix for which
 it finds a valid file name."
----------------------------
revision 1.7
date: 2002/03/19 20:55:35;  author: oakden;  state: Exp;  lines: +47 -12
Added command line parsing for scid args.
Added small pause to allow new scid to register before rebuilding lists.
Fixed bug - isBusy now checks if SCID has finished starting up as well as
querying the cursor status.
