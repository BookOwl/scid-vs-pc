  1.  introduction


  Shane's Chess Information Database is a powerful Chess Toolkit, with
  which one can create huge chess databases, run engine analysis, or
  play casual games against the computer or online with the Free
  Internet Chess Server. It was originally written by Shane Hudson , and
  has received strong contribution from Pascal Georges and others.

  Scid vs. PC <http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/> is a usability and bug-
  fix fork of Scid with some new features. The project is authored by
  ``Stevenaaus'', and has been extensively tested with the Million Base
  and other huge databases.

  2.  features

  See ``changes'' for a comprehensive changelog, or the gallery
  <https://sourceforge.net/apps/gallery/scidvspc/index.php> for some
  screenshots..

  2.0.1.  New and Improved features

  o  Computer Tournaments.

  o  Rewritten Gamelist widget, with the incorporated Database Switcher.

  o  Improved Computer Game and FICs features.

  o  Clickable Variation Arrows, and Paste Variation feature.

  o  Improved Undo and Redo.

  o  Tri-coloured Tree Bar-Graphs alongside statistics.

  o  PGN can be shown as chess figures/fonts.

  o  Ratings Graph can show multiple players.

  o  Book tuning Remove Move feature.

  o  Separate board sections are hideable via right-click.

  o  A redone Button Bar with improved look and feel.

  o  Restructured Analysis Engines. The function hotkeys can be set
     explicitly, Engine 1 can be docked into the Status Bar, and any
     number of engines may run at one time. Engine Annotation has also
     been rewritten, Engine Logs are viewable.

  o  The Chessboard/Pieces options have been totally overhauled. There
     are some new colour and tile themes, and great piece sets available
     if the optional TkImg package is installed.

  o  The Setup Start Board has many fixes and improvements.

  o  The Help index is now meaningful to new users, with links to the
     game's main features.

  o  Countless bug-fixes.

  2.0.2.  Missing Features

  o  SCID's half-implemented Docked Mode is not included. It introduces
     quite a few bugs; keyboard input is mostly broken, and many windows
     just can't size properly.

  o  Some language translations need volunteers and updating.

  https://scidvspc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scidvspc

  4.  installation

  4.0.1.  Linux , FreeBSD

  Scid vs. PC requires Tcl/Tk <http://tcl.tk> 8.5 or 8.6.  Tcl/Tk 8.5.10
  has nasty bugs and should be avoided.Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk
  installed by default.  To verify this, look for a command named wish
  or wish8.5.  To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as
  Berlin), you may need to install TkImg
  <https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2>.
  Then, installing from source:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.8.tgz
  cd scid_vs_pc-4.8
  configure
  make install
  scid
  ______________________________________________________________________


  It is also possible to install Scid vs. PC into /usr, instead of the
  normal /usr/local.  This allows for parallel installation with
  mainline Scid, and is done by: ./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/
  SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/
  Scid's multi-language support can cause problems. Chinese (and other)
  users should use: ./configure LANGUAGES=""

  4.0.2.  Windows

  Windows installation simply requires downloading the ``executable'',
  and following the prompts.

  The configuration files, including the chess engine list, are stored
  in the Scid-vs-PC/bin/config directory, and may be copied over from
  old versions to make upgrading easier.

  Just after installation on Windows 7, Scid vs. PC can crash upon exit,
  with an ntdll.dll error. This known issue seems harmless, and to
  resolve itself after a reboot.

  4.0.3.  Mac OS X

  The ``ScidvsMac-4.8 app'' should include everything you need. Simply
  drag and drop the App into /Applications (or similar).

  Users upgrading may have to remove (or edit)
  $HOME/.scidvspc/config/engines.dat to properly configure the chess
  engines.

  To compile from source - once you have XCode installed - please read
  ScidvsMac-HowTo.rtfd in the source tarball.

  OS X's Cocoa port of Wish is broken, with little chance of repair.
  Scid vs PC ships with a custom Carbon build of Wish.

  Well, the html is up, and i've got a couple of files in the downloads
  section. My project is fairly modest fork of Scid ... just rewriting
  Tk widgets when i get the urge.

  6.  miscellaneous

  6.1.  how to play


     Playing against the Computer
        The main Computer vs. Player feature is accessed from
        Play->Computer. Here you'll find options to play against Phalanx
        (a flexible computer opponent whose skill you can select), or
        any installed UCI engine.

     Playing on the Internet
        Playing on the Internet is done via the the Play->Internet menu
        item. I recommend visiting the Fics <http://www.freechess.org>
        website to create a user account, but it is also possible to
        play anonymously. To start a game, press the Login as Guest
        button, then watch the available games as they are announced in
        the console. Enter play [game number] to accept a game
        challenge.


  There is more information about the Fics and Tactical Game features in
  the Scid Help menus.

  6.2.  known issues


  o  Just after installation on Windows 7, ScidvsPC can crash upon exit,
     with an ntdll.dll error. This seems harmless, and to resolve itself
     after a reboot.  The issue is unresolved, but can be worked around
     by running Scid vs.  PC with administrator privilidges.

  o  Chinese Language Support. Scid's multilanguage support is broken
     for some countries. The work around involves compiling from source,
     using: ./configure LANGUAGES=""
     Alternatively, remove all lines between "### deutsch.tcl" and "#
     end of russian.tcl" in the scid.gui file.

  o  Focus Issues. Kde users can allow Tcl apps to properly raise
     themselves by configuring desktop > window behavior > advanced >
     focus stealing prevention set to "none"

  6.3.  bugs


  o  Tcl/Tk 8.5.10 has nasty bugs (which affect the gamelist and setup
     board widgets) and is not recommended.

  o  Importing huge PGN archives can sometimes fail. The command line
     utility pgnscid is a more reliable way to create large databases
     from pgn. Typing "pgnscid somefile.pgn" creates a new database
     "somefile.si4".

  o  Using the '+' operator and clicking on 'Find' in the gamelist
     widget can be very slow. The code needs to be moved from
     gamelist.tcl to tkscid.cpp.

  o  Windows only:


     o  Using "ALT+F"... etc key bindings to access the menus is badly
        broke. This is a Tcl/Tk issue.

     o  Window focus/raise issues, another Tcl/Tk issue.

  6.4.  thanks

  Thanks to Gregor Cramer <http://scidb.sf.net> for the PGN figurines
  and Drag and Drop features, and technical support.

  For Gilles and Dorothy for OSX packages, Jiri Pavlovsky for the
  windows installer, and all Scid vs. PC testers.

  Sourceforge.net <http://sourceforge.net> for their great hosting,

  Pascal Georges for his many technical contributions.

  Fulvio and Gerd for their much appreciated contributions to mainline
  Scid.

  Michal Rudolf <http://chessx.sf.net> and Alex Wagner for initial
  feedback and bug-reports,

  and of course Shane Hudson, and the authors of Tcl/Tk <http://tcl.tk>

  6.5.  scid's history

  Scid is a huge project, with an interesting history. Originally
  authored by Shane Hudson from New Zealand, it combined the power of
  Tk's GUI and the speed of C, to produce a free Chess Database
  application with Opening Reports, Tree Analysis, and Tablebase
  support.  It gained quite some attention, as it was arguably the first
  project of it's kind; but after writing over a hundred thousand lines
  of code, in 2004 development stopped. Shane never contributed to Scid
  again. He was generally reported to be seriously ill, and today has
  little if no contact with the current Scid community.

  Two new versions of Scid appeared around 2006. The first was ChessDB
  authored by Dr. David Kirby. With some good documentation and the
  ability to automatically download games from several web portals, it
  became popular. But at the same time Pascal Georges from France was
  making strong technical improvements to Scid. Frustrated with Scid's
  dormancy, and because of disagreements with ChessDB's author, Pascal
  released his own tree, Scid-pg, which included UCI support and
  numerous Player versus Computer features.

  But subtley, and with some controversy, he began to adopt the name
  Scid as his own. Some people objected, especially Dr. Kirby, with whom
  a flame war began, but Pascal's efforts to gain ownership of the
  Sourceforge Scid project eventually succeeded.

  Under Pascal, and with the help of numerous contributors, Scid again
  strode forward. Pascal wrote a Tree Mask feature, and in 2009 he
  upgraded the database format to si4, all the time making speed and
  technical improvements to the neglect of the interface. Very recently,
  Pascal has contributed less to the project, but it still thrives as a
  feature rich database application, with a strong community headed by a
  core group of programmers.

  But along the way, there exist other Scid projects. Chessx, by Michal
  Rudolf from Germany, is a rewrite of Scid using the powerful libQT
  API, popularized by KDE-4.  Originally called Newscid, Chessx still
  grows, but with a much smaller feature set, and lesser popularity than
  Scid.


  Scid vs. PC (by Steven Atkinson from Australia) began around mid 2009.
  Forked from Scid-3.6.26, it began as an effort to tidy Shane's
  frenetic code base, improve the user interface , and add polish to
  Scid's rich feature set; but it is now probably the most mature fork.
  Unfortunately, the state of mainline SCID's git repository is not
  good. It has new features with many bugs, receives little or no
  updates, and a new release is not eminent.

  Another project is reaching its initial public release. Scidb, by
  Gregor Cramer from Germany, is a total rewrite of Scid. It thoroughly
  utilizes C++ and a heavily customized Tk interface, and includes
  Chessbase database support and Chess960/other variants among it's
  features.
