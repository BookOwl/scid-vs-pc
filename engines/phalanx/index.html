<UL>
<LI> Fix win32 related bugs
<P>Currently win32 polling now works, but has a bug. It does not get updated when making a move in Scid.
The issue is with the "interrupt" proc. This proc is getting called in Linux, but not in WIN32.
I tried changing all Jim's "signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);" to "signal(SIGINT,interrupt);" but it
didn't work, so i'm assuming that on WIN32, io.c::interrupt() is getting replaced by a system call. </P>

<LI> Format C source code (with <B>indent</B> ?) , to allow for easy
program diffing with the various phalanx forks still around.</LI>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>February 2012 : Code contributed by Jim Ablett (sourced from Olithink) to allow polling in win32
, and also some (cross platform) time related fixes.</LI>
<LI>August   2011 : Add enpassant and 50 rule parsing pf FEN, remove CC warnings and add protover command</LI>
<LI>October  2010 : Added millisecond time control</LI>
<LI>October  2010 : Windows binary compiled against cygwin-1.7.5-1</LI>
<LI>October  2010 : Sync-ed with Scid vs. PC's phalanx (adding "st" command, and fixing illegal castling)</LI>
<LI>October  2010 : Sourceforge Phalanx project now maintained by stevenaaus</LI>
<LI>December 2006 : added setboard option - Pascal Georges</LI>

<P><B>Welcome to the new Phalanx Chess home</B></P>
<P>This is the website for the Phalanx chess engine. It was created by a young Czech student, Dusan Dobes, but he vanished from the Internet around the year 2000. Luckily, he released Phalanx under the GPL license, so his work won't be forgotten; on the contrary, I hope that the community will help improve it and make it a worthy opponent to other chess engines.</P>
<P>Phalanx's playing style is quite human-like; when it plays at full strength, it may be compared to a intermediate-to-strong club player; beginners will be right at home with it, too.</P>
<P>I made some very little changes on Dobes's latest version of Phalanx so it could compile and run on any modern GNU/Linux system. The GCC compiler is required, as it uses some of its extensions. I plan to change that.</P>
<P>You can download, report bugs, and discuss Phalanx on the Project page, or make any requests to me directly, espinafre at users dot sourceforge dot net.</P>

<P>2006-02-15 22:13 GMT -3:00 Windows version has a problem with Arena: phalanx seems to hang after the book moves. Currently known workaround is to pass the option '-o -' to Phalanx's command line. Thanks to Dario Zucco for reporting this!</P>

<P>PhalanxXXII was the most interesting of the seven engines (in my opinion). I
was looking forward to a wild sacrificial game against it (based on the
engine's description at the ChessBase GmbH site), but Phalanx fooled me. I
played a couple of games against it immediately after replaying a couple of
Steinitz' games from Reti's book Masters of the Chessboard. Steinitz was the
master of the pawn push. He often drove his pawns relentlessly forward to deny
space to his opponent. To my surprise (I might even say "shock"), Phalanx does
the same thing. Control of space is evidently given high priority in its
evaluation algorithm. As I played against Phalanx, it seemed intent on
throttling me ("python-like", to use the hoary old stereotype). I give this
program high marks for positional play -- the pawn pushes it made were all
strong ones, and it never gave my Knights a chance to exploit any holes it may
have created. Despite the relatively low rating range in "Handicap and fun"
mode (1150-1950), Phalanx was without question the most unique and interesting
of the seven engines and I'm looking forward to my next game against it.</P>

<P>Definition: phalanx: Chess playing program. Phalanx is a simple chess playing program of conventional design. It is xboard compatible. The main aim is to write a slow thinker with a lot of chess specific knowledge. Current version plays risky, active chess and shows quite good tactical performance. </P>
