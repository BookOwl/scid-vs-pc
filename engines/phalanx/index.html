<P>PhalanxXXII was the most interesting of the seven engines (in my opinion). I
was looking forward to a wild sacrificial game against it (based on the
engine's description at the ChessBase GmbH site), but Phalanx fooled me. I
played a couple of games against it immediately after replaying a couple of
Steinitz' games from Reti's book Masters of the Chessboard. Steinitz was the
master of the pawn push. He often drove his pawns relentlessly forward to deny
space to his opponent. To my surprise (I might even say "shock"), Phalanx does
the same thing. Control of space is evidently given high priority in its
evaluation algorithm. As I played against Phalanx, it seemed intent on
throttling me ("python-like", to use the hoary old stereotype). I give this
program high marks for positional play -- the pawn pushes it made were all
strong ones, and it never gave my Knights a chance to exploit any holes it may
have created. Despite the relatively low rating range in "Handicap and fun"
mode (1150-1950), Phalanx was without question the most unique and interesting
of the seven engines and I'm looking forward to my next game against it.</P>

<P>Definition: phalanx: Chess playing program. Phalanx is a simple chess playing program of conventional design. It is xboard compatible. The main aim is to write a slow thinker with a lot of chess specific knowledge. Current version plays risky, active chess and shows quite good tactical performance. </P>
