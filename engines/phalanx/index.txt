  1.  introduction

  Phalanx is an old, popular chess engine, with an interesting
  ``history''.

  The latest code can be obtained from subversion with to {svn co
  https://phalanx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phalanx}

  2.  downloads

  source phalanx-XXIII-beta.tgz
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phalanx/files/Version%20XXIII%20Beta/phalanx-
  XXIII-beta.tgz/download>

  windows phalanx-XXIII-win32-beta.tgz
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phalanx/files/Version%20XXIII%20Beta/phalanx-
  XXIII-win32-beta.tgz/download>

  Jim Ablett's windows/android/linux binaries phalanx-xxiii-ja.zip
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phalanx/files/JA/phalanx-xxiii-
  ja.zip/download>

  Unfortunately both windows versions above have minor bugs.  Jim
  Ablett's version should be used for tournament matches.  phalanx-
  XXIII-win32-beta should be used for Scid's analysis window.

  o  Fix win32 related bugs

     Currently win32 polling now works, but has a bug. It does not get
     updated when making a move in Scid.  The issue is with the
     "interrupt" proc. This proc is getting called in Linux, but not in
     WIN32.  I tried changing all Jim's "signal(SIGINT, handleSigint);"
     to "signal(SIGINT,interrupt);" but it didn't work, so i'm assuming
     that on WIN32, io.c::interrupt() is getting replaced by a system
     call.

  o  Format C source code (with indent ?) , to allow for easy program
     diffing with the various phalanx forks still around.


  4.  changes


  o  February 2012 : Code contributed by Jim Ablett (sourced from
     Olithink) to allow polling in win32 , and also some (cross
     platform) time related fixes.

  o  August 2011 : Add enpassant and 50 rule parsing pf FEN, remove CC
     warnings and add protover command

  o  October 2010 : Added millisecond time control

  o  October 2010 : Windows binary compiled against cygwin-1.7.5-1

  o  October 2010 : Sync-ed with Scid vs. PC's phalanx (adding "st"
     command, and fixing illegal castling)

  o  October 2010 : Sourceforge Phalanx project now maintained by
     stevenaaus

  o  December 2006 : added setboard option - Pascal Georges

     This is the old web page, by Phalanx Reborn's author - Jos de
     Paula.

        Welcome to the new Phalanx Chess home

        This is the website for the Phalanx chess engine. It was created
        by a young Czech student, Dusan Dobes, but he vanished from the
        Internet around the year 2000. Luckily, he released Phalanx
        under the GPL license, so his work won't be forgotten; on the
        contrary, I hope that the community will help improve it and
        make it a worthy opponent to other chess engines.

        Phalanx's playing style is quite human-like; when it plays at
        full strength, it may be compared to a intermediate-to-strong
        club player; beginners will be right at home with it, too.

        I made some very little changes on Dobes's latest version of
        Phalanx so it could compile and run on any modern GNU/Linux
        system. The GCC compiler is required, as it uses some of its
        extensions. I plan to change that.

        You can download, report bugs, and discuss Phalanx on the
        Project page, or make any requests to me directly, espinafre at
        users dot sourceforge dot net.

        News

        2006-02-15 22:13 GMT -3:00 Windows version has a problem with
        Arena: phalanx seems to hang after the book moves. Currently
        known workaround is to pass the option '-o -' to Phalanx's
        command line. Thanks to Dario Zucco for reporting this!

        PhalanxXXII was the most interesting of the seven engines (in my
        opinion). I was looking forward to a wild sacrificial game
        against it (based on the engine's description at the ChessBase
        GmbH site), but Phalanx fooled me. I played a couple of games
        against it immediately after replaying a couple of Steinitz'
        games from Reti's book Masters of the Chessboard. Steinitz was
        the master of the pawn push. He often drove his pawns
        relentlessly forward to deny space to his opponent. To my
        surprise (I might even say "shock"), Phalanx does the same
        thing. Control of space is evidently given high priority in its
        evaluation algorithm. As I played against Phalanx, it seemed
        intent on throttling me ("python-like", to use the hoary old
        stereotype). I give this program high marks for positional play
        -- the pawn pushes it made were all strong ones, and it never
        gave my Knights a chance to exploit any holes it may have
        created. Despite the relatively low rating range in "Handicap
        and fun" mode (1150-1950), Phalanx was without question the most
        unique and interesting of the seven engines and I'm looking
        forward to my next game against it.

        Definition: phalanx: Chess playing program. Phalanx is a simple
        chess playing program of conventional design. It is xboard
        compatible. The main aim is to write a slow thinker with a lot
        of chess specific knowledge. Current version plays risky, active
        chess and shows quite good tactical performance.
