        PhalanxXXII was the most interesting of the seven engines (in my
        opinion). I was looking forward to a wild sacrificial game
        against it (based on the engine's description at the ChessBase
        GmbH site), but Phalanx fooled me. I played a couple of games
        against it immediately after replaying a couple of Steinitz'
        games from Reti's book Masters of the Chessboard. Steinitz was
        the master of the pawn push. He often drove his pawns
        relentlessly forward to deny space to his opponent. To my
        surprise (I might even say "shock"), Phalanx does the same
        thing. Control of space is evidently given high priority in its
        evaluation algorithm. As I played against Phalanx, it seemed
        intent on throttling me ("python-like", to use the hoary old
        stereotype). I give this program high marks for positional play
        -- the pawn pushes it made were all strong ones, and it never
        gave my Knights a chance to exploit any holes it may have
        created. Despite the relatively low rating range in "Handicap
        and fun" mode (1150-1950), Phalanx was without question the most
        unique and interesting of the seven engines and I'm looking
        forward to my next game against it.

        Definition: phalanx: Chess playing program. Phalanx is a simple
        chess playing program of conventional design. It is xboard
        compatible. The main aim is to write a slow thinker with a lot
        of chess specific knowledge. Current version plays risky, active
        chess and shows quite good tactical performance.
