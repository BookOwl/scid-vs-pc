<bf>Shane's Chess Information Database</bf> is a powerful Chess Toolkit, with
which one can create huge chess databases, run engine analysis, or play
casual games against the computer or online with the Free Internet Chess
Server. It was originally written by Shane Hudson , and has received strong
contribution from Pascal Georges and others.

<url url="http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/" name="Scid vs. PC"> is a usability
and bug-fix fork of Scid with some new features.  The project is authored by <ref name="Stevenaaus"
id="contact_">, and has been extensively tested.

<sect> installation <p>

<sect2> Linux , FreeBSD<p>

Scid vs. PC requires <url name="Tcl/Tk" url="http://tcl.tk"> 8.5.
<em>Tcl/Tk 8.5.10 has nasty bugs and should be avoided.</em></p>

Most Unices should have Tcl/Tk installed by default.
To verify this, look for a command named <bf>wish</bf> or <bf>wish8.5</bf>.
To enable support for extra chess pieces (such as Berlin), you may need to install
<url name="TkImg" url="https://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=263836&amp;filename=tkimg1.3.tar.bz2">.  
Then, installing from source:
<code>
tar -xzf scid_vs_pc-4.9.1.tgz
cd scid_vs_pc-4.9.1
configure
make install
scid
</code>

<em>It is also possible to install Scid vs. PC into <bf>/usr</bf>, instead of the normal <bf>/usr/local</bf>.
This allows for parallel installation with mainline Scid, and is done by: <bf>./configure BINDIR=/usr/bin/ SHAREDIR=/usr/share/scid/</bf>
<newline><newline>Scid's multi-language support can cause problems. Chinese (and other) users should use: <bf>./configure LANGUAGES=""</bf></em>


<sect2> Windows <p>
Windows installation simply requires downloading the <ref name="executable" id="download_">, and following the prompts.
</p>
<p>
The configuration files, <bf>including the chess engine list</bf>, are stored
in the <bf>Scid-vs-PC\bin\config</bf> directory, and may be copied over from
old versions to make upgrading easier. On Windows 7, these files are mirrored in
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Scid vs PC
</p>
<p>People with Visual Studio 11 should now be able to compile the project fairly easily (see Makefile.vc for more details).</p>

<sect2> Mac OS X <p>

The <ref name="ScidvsMac-4.9.2 app" id="download_"> should include everything you need. Simply drag and drop the App into /Applications (or similar).

<em>Users upgrading may have to remove (or edit) <bf>$HOME/.scidvspc/config/engines.dat</bf>
to properly configure the chess engines.</em>

OS X  has a poor implementation of Tcl, and docked mode has bugs (some windows work better after being moved around, keyboard shortcuts are very hit and miss). These issues should be fixed with a point release sometime in the future.

To compile from source - once you have XCode installed - please read <bf>ScidvsMac-HowTo.rtfd</bf> in the source tarball.

<em>OS X's Cocoa port of Wish is broken, with little chance of repair. Scid vs PC ships with a custom Carbon build of Wish.</em>

<bf> June 23, 2009 </bf>

The monkey on my back has really been having a good time.  This release includes changes to the Gameinfo, Comment Editor, and Board Style widgets, some new chess pieces, colour schemes and tiles. Thanks to Michal and Alex for feedback.

<bf> June 4, 2009 </bf>

Well, the html is up, and i've got a couple of
files in the downloads section. My project is fairly modest fork of Scid
... just rewriting Tk widgets when i get the urge.

<sect> miscellaneous <p>

<sect1> docked windows <p>

This powerful feature has a few issues.
<itemize>
<item> Tcl/Tk 8.6.0 may have issues.
<item>In the event of Scid failing to start, restart the program with the <bf>-nodock</bf> option.
<item> Key bindings (especially menus) can be hit and miss.
<item> Windows undocked from within docking mode can have glitches.
Mainly: drag and drop game copies in the switcher don't work.
<item>OS X support is not good.
</itemize>
Make sure to check out the new Theme Options, which affect how the Docked Windows (and Gamelist) look and feel.

<sect1> how to play <p>

<descrip>

<tag/Playing against the Computer/
The main Computer vs. Player feature is accessed from <bf>Play->Computer</bf>. Here
you'll find options to play against Phalanx (a flexible computer opponent whose
skill you can select), or any installed UCI engine.

<tag/Playing on the Internet/
Playing on the Internet is done via the the
<bf>Play->Internet</bf> menu item. I recommend visiting the <url
url="http://www.freechess.org" name="Fics"> website to create a user
account, but it is also possible to play anonymously. To start a game,
press the <bf>Login as Guest</bf> button, then watch the available games as they are
announced in the console. Enter <bf>play [game number]</bf> to accept a
game challenge.

</descrip>

<em>There is more information
about the Fics and Tactical Game features in the Scid Help menus</em>.


<sect1> todo <p>
<itemize>
<item> Openseal is an open source version of FICS Timeseal. It needs some
rewriting to work with Scid, though it is a small program.

<item> FICS could be adapted to work with the ICC. The work involves
analysing the differences in the strings used by the two programs.
(for example, for FICS  we have this line to ackowledge successful log-in
   if {[string match "*Starting FICS session*" $line]} {
The two servers do have many similarities i think, and examining
xboard's "backend.c" (or some other client) for "FICS" particularities

<item> Russian translation is broken afaics, and has been removed for the time being.

<item> The month i've updated the translations a little. (Thanks to Peter
for totally overhauling the Dutch one). The checklangs.tcl script is
in much better shape, but of course there are still lots of
translation "todos"

<item> The TCL sound package, Snack, needs a maintainer.

<item> There was a lot of work done to implement Fischer Chess (Chess 960),
but they never fixed all the bugs, and the web site
http://www.wtfai.me.uk/scid960.html is now gone. The latest code is in
ScidvsPC's source patches/chess960.patch

<item> The Tree code works reasonably well, but i have never found the time
to overhaul the Slow/Fast/Slow&Fast modes. These were (for a long
time) negelected when Fulvio wrote the interuptible tree code. Scid
now has the Modes removed, so doing this in ScidvsPC probably wouldnt
be terribly hard to do.

<item> There are two engine types - UCI and XBoard. Pascal's UCI code is in
some ways inferior to Shane's Xboard code.
Though this is mostly mitigated by the speed of modern processors,
it'd be nice to make use of the UCI ponder feature in analysis mode
(Comp mode already does so).

<item> I've never had a chance to verify/update the Novag Citrine drivers
and interface due to lack of hardware.

<item> Our Windows port needs a little overhaul to properly use Users home
directory to store all the various data.
I will get around to doing it one day though.

<item> A lot of people use chessbase books (.ctg). Scid can only read
polyglot opening books, but inlining this projects
work may not be too hard.  https://github.com/sshivaji/ctgexporter

</itemize></p>

<sect1> known issues <p>
<itemize>
<item> Tcl/Tk-8.5.10 is buggy. Tcl/Tk-8.6.0 also is immature, but mostly works.
<item> OS X docked mode has multiple issues due to it's poor Tcl/Tk.
<item> <bf>Chinese Language Support</bf>. Scid's multilanguage support is broken
for some countries. The work around involves compiling from source, using:
<em>./configure LANGUAGES=""</em>
<newline>Alternatively, remove all lines between "### deutsch.tcl" and "# end of serbian.tcl" in the scid.gui file.
<item> <bf>Focus Issues</bf>. Kde users can allow Tcl apps to properly raise themselves by
configuring <i>desktop > window behavior > advanced > focus stealing prevention</i>
set to "none"
</itemize>


<sect1> bugs <p>

<itemize>
<item> See the known issues about Tcl/Tk (above).
<item> Importing huge PGN archives can
sometimes fail. The command line utility <bf>pgnscid</bf> is a more reliable way
to create large databases from pgn. Typing "pgnscid somefile.pgn" creates a new database
"somefile.si4".
<item> Using the '+' operator and clicking on 'Find' in the gamelist widget can be very slow. The code needs to be moved from gamelist.tcl to tkscid.cpp.
<item> Windows only:
<itemize>
<item> Using "ALT+F"... etc key bindings to access the menus is badly broke. This is a Tcl/Tk issue.
<item> Window focus/raise issues, another Tcl/Tk issue. 
</itemize>
</itemize>

</p>

<sect1> scid's history <p>

<p>Scid is a huge project, with an interesting history. Originally authored by
Shane Hudson from New Zealand, it combined the power of Tk's GUI and
the speed of C, to produce a free Chess Database application with 
Opening Reports, Tree Analysis, and Tablebase support.
It gained quite some attention, as it was arguably the first project of it's
kind; but after writing over a hundred thousand lines of code, in 2004 development
stopped. Shane never contributed to Scid again. He was generally reported
to be seriously ill, and today has little if no contact with the current Scid community.</p>
<p> Two new versions of Scid appeared around 2006. The first was ChessDB
authored by Dr. David Kirby. With some good documentation and 
the ability to automatically download games from
several web portals, it became popular. But at the same time Pascal Georges from France
was making strong technical improvements to Scid. Frustrated with Scid's dormancy,
and because of disagreements with ChessDB's author, Pascal released his own tree, Scid-pg, which 
included UCI support and numerous Player versus Computer features.</p>
<p> But subtley, and with some controversy, he began to adopt the name Scid as his own. Some
people objected, especially Dr. Kirby, with whom a flame war began, but 
Pascal's efforts to gain ownership of the Sourceforge Scid project eventually succeeded.</p>
<p>Under Pascal, and with the help of numerous contributors, Scid again strode
forward. Pascal wrote a Tree Mask feature, and in 2009
he upgraded the database format to si4, all the time making speed and technical improvements
to the neglect of the interface. Very recently, Pascal has contributed less
to the project, but it still thrives as a feature rich database application,
with a strong community headed by a core group of programmers.</p>
<p>But along the way, there exist other Scid projects. Chessx, by Michal Rudolf from
Germany, is a rewrite of Scid using the powerful libQT API, popularized by KDE-4.
Originally called Newscid, Chessx still grows, but with a much smaller feature set,
and lesser popularity than Scid.</p>
<p>Scid vs. PC (by Steven Atkinson from Australia) began around mid 2009. Forked from Scid-3.6.26, it began as an effort to tidy Shane's frenetic code base, improve the user interface , and add polish to Scid's rich feature set; but it is now probably the most mature fork. Unfortunately, the state of mainline SCID's git repository is not good. It has new features with many bugs, receives little or no updates, and a new release is not eminent.</p>
<p>Another project is reaching its initial public release. Scidb, by Gregor Cramer from Germany, is a total rewrite of Scid. It thoroughly utilizes C++ and a heavily customized Tk interface, and includes Chessbase database support and Chess960/other variants among it's features.</p>
